TITLE II--ENHANCED SMALL BUSINESS ACCESS TO FEDERAL INNOVATION INVESTMENTS (Sec. 201) The bill specifies budget amounts for the Department of Defense (DOD) (for extramural expenditures and those for research, development, test, and evaluation) and other federal agencies to obligate for expenditure with small business concerns under the SBIR and STTR programs. (Sec. 202) The Small Business Administration (SBA) shall modify certain policy directives to eliminate automatic annual inflation adjustments to awards under Phases I and II of the SBIR program. (Phase I is a six-month exploration of the technical merit or feasibility of an idea or technology. Phase II, which may be for up to two years, is research, development, and evaluation of the potential of Phase I ideas or technologies for commercialization.) The bill expresses the sense of Congress that for FY2019, and every third fiscal year following, Congress should evaluate whether the maximum award sizes under the SBIR and STTR programs should be adjusted and, if so, take appropriate action to require such adjustments to be made under specified SBIR policy directives. A federal agency head shall ensure that any sequential Phase II award is made in accordance with specified limitations on award sizes. (A sequential Phase II award is an additional Phase II award for research and development of an idea or technology that evaluates the potential for commercialization.) A small business concern that receives a sequential Phase II SBIR or Phase II STTR award for a project from a federal agency shall be eligible to receive an additional sequential Phase II award that continues work on that project from another federal agency. TITLE III--COMMERCIALIZATION IMPROVEMENTS (Sec. 301)The bill makes permanent the Commercialization Development Awards pilot program under which the SBA makes awards:  for technology development, testing, evaluation, and commercialization assistance for SBIR and STTR Phase II technologies; or to support the progress of research, research and development, and commercialization conducted under the SBIR or STTR programs to Phase III (in which a small business pursues, without SBA funding, commercialization objectives resulting from the Phase I/II activities).  (Sec. 302) The national small business goal for federal agency research and development programs shall be at least 10% for FY2018 and ensuing fiscal years. (Sec. 303) Annual reports to Congress on the SBIR and STTR programs shall include information regarding awards under the Rapid Innovation Program under the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011. (Sec. 304) An SBIR or STTR award may cover the indirect cost of seeking protection for intellectual property created through work performed under it.  No federal agency may inhibit directly or indirectly the recovery of patent costs by an otherwise eligible small business concern performing under an SBIR or STTR award, including:  costs for searching the art necessary to make invention disclosures; other costs connected with the filing and prosecution of a U.S. patent application where title or royalty-free license is to be conveyed to the federal government; and general counseling services relating to patent matters.  These patent costs shall be allowable for technology developed under:  a Phase I award, as indirect costs of up to $5,000; a Phase II award, as indirect costs of up to $15,000; and a Phase III award in which the federal government has specified government purpose rights.  (Sec. 305) The Government Accountability Office (GAO) shall audit annually federal government compliance with SBIR and STTR goals and incentives. (Sec. 306) Federal agencies and prime contractors shall issue Phase III awards relating to technology, including sole source awards, to the SBIR and STTR award recipients that developed the technology. (Sec. 307) Each federal agency required to conduct an SBIR or an STTR program may enter into an agreement with one (as in current law) or more vendors to give small business concerns engaged in SBIR or STTR projects technical assistance (as in current law) and business assistance services, such as assistance with product sales, intellectual property protections, market research, market validation, and development of regulatory and manufacturing plans, as well as intellectual property protections. A small business concern as well as a federal agency may, by contract or otherwise, select one or more vendors to assist the small business concern in meeting program goals. The amount that a federal agency may give a recipient of a Phase I SBIR or STTR award through a vendor, or that the agency may authorize for a recipient in order to purchase allowable services, shall change from up to $5,000 per year to up to $6,500 per project. The counterpart amounts for the recipient of a Phase II SBIR or STTR award shall change from up to $5,000 per year to up to $35,000 per project. The amount for purchase of services may be included as part of the recipient's award or be in addition to the amount of the recipient's award. Business-related services aimed at improving the commercialization success of a small business concern may be obtained from an entity, such as a public or private organization, a state agency, or another state-established or -funded entity, that facilitates or accelerates the commercialization of technologies or assists in the creation and growth of private enterprises that are commercializing technology. The SBA shall establish a fiscal year limit on the amount of technical and business assistance services that may be received or purchased by small business concerns with respect to multiple Phase II SBIR or STTR awards. TITLE IV--PROGRAM DIVERSIFICATION INITIATIVES (Sec. 401) The SBA shall allow each federal agency required to conduct an SBIR program to use certain funds for improvements that increase commonality across data systems, reduce redundancy, and improve data oversight and accuracy. The SBA shall establish a Regional SBIR State Collaborative Initiative Pilot Program under which it shall make awards to regional collaboratives to address the needs of small business concerns in order to:  be more competitive in the proposal and selection process for SBIR and STTR awards, and   increase technology transfer and commercialization.  The SBA shall award each eligible state in a regional collaborative up to $300,000 to carry out collaborative activities. The Pilot Program shall terminate at the end of FY2021. (Sec. 402) The bill reauthorizes the Federal and State Technology (FAST) Partnership Program through FY2021. TITLE V--OVERSIGHT AND SIMPLIFICATION INITIATIVES (Sec. 501) The bill establishes an SBIR and STTR Interagency Policy Committee to:  determine how to collect data on achievements by small business concerns in each phase of the programs;  establish a uniform baseline for metrics that support improving the solicitation, contracting, funding, and execution of program management; normalize formatting and database usage across participating federal agencies; and determine the feasibility of developing a common system across all participating federal agencies and related paperwork requirements.  (Sec. 502) For FY2018-FY2019 any federal agency that has not implemented specified SBIR and STTR requirements must continue to pay the SBA specified funds for the Regional SBIR State Collaborative Initiative Pilot Program and the FAST Partnership Program, and to support the SBA Office of the Administration that administers those programs; but may not use any additional amounts until a certain time after it complies fully with those requirements. (Sec. 503) The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Agriculture, and the National Science Foundation shall make final decisions on each proposal submitted under its SBIR and STTR programs by specified deadlines. (Sec. 504) The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 is amended to extend until the GAO submits its FY2019 report the GAO duty to conduct fiscal and management audits of the SBIR and STTR programs. The GAO shall assess whether the change in the base funding for DOD under Sec. 201 of this bill:   improves transparency for determining whether DOD is complying with SBIR AND STTR allocation requirements, reduces the burden of calculating the allocations, and improves DOD compliance with those allocation requirements.  TITLE VI--PARTICIPATION BY WOMEN AND MINORITIES (Sec. 601) The SBA shall coordinate with participating agencies on efforts to increase outreach and awards under the SBIR and STTR programs to small business concerns owned and controlled by women and socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns. (Sec. 602) Each federal agency required to establish an SBIR program shall implement an SBIR outreach program to all such concerns. (Sec. 603) The SBA shall modify its STTR policy directive to emphasize enhanced outreach efforts to increase the participation of such concerns in technological innovation and in STTR programs. (Sec. 604) The SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act of 2011 is amended to require the Interagency SBIR/STTR Policy Committee to meet at least twice a year. If it meets to discuss outreach and technical assistance activities to increase the participation of small business concerns underrepresented in the SBIR and STTR programs, it shall invite a representative of the Minority Business Development Agency and relevant stakeholders working to advance the interests of small business concerns owned and controlled by women and by socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns. (Sec. 605) The SBA shall establish a four-year Diversity and STEM Workforce Development Pilot Program to encourage the business community to create workforce development opportunities for science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) interns, under which a federal agency participating in the SBIR or the STTR program may make a grant of up to $15,000 per year to one or more eligible entities for the costs of internships for covered STEM interns. TITLE VII--TECHNICAL CHANGES (Sec. 701) HHS generally (currently only the National Institutes of Health) may:  grant a small business concern a Phase II SBIR award for a project without regard to whether the concern received a Phase I award for the project, if certain requirements are met; and  award competitively up to 25% of the funds allocated for the SBIR program to small business concerns owned in majority part by multiple venture capital operating companies, hedge funds, or private equity firms.

At least: (1) 100 megahertz shall be made available on an unlicensed basis; and (2) 100 megahertz shall be made available on an exclusive, licensed basis for commercial mobile use, subject to the FCC's regulatory purview, including consideration of continued use of such spectrum by incumbent federal or nonfederal entities in designated geographic areas indefinitely. In making such spectrum available, the Department of Commerce and the FCC must consider: (1) the need to preserve critical existing and planned federal government capabilities; (2) the impact on existing state, local, and tribal government capabilities; (3) international implications; (4) appropriate enforcement mechanisms and authorities; and (5) the importance of the deployment of wireless broadband services in rural areas. (Sec. 4) The NTIA must submit to Congress and the FCC an assessment of the feasibility of authorizing mobile or fixed terrestrial wireless operations, including for advanced mobile service operations, on federal entities and operations in specified frequency bands. The FCC must publish a notice of proposed rulemaking within two years after enactment of this bill, or within 90 days after it receives the NTIA's feasibility assessment, whichever is earlier, to consider service rules authorizing such operations. (Sec. 5) Commerce and the FCC must submit reports evaluating the feasibility of allowing commercial wireless services to share use of specified frequencies between 3100 and 4200 megahertz. If such sharing is feasible, the reports must identify which of the frequencies are most suitable for sharing with commercial wireless services through the assignment of new licenses by competitive bidding, for sharing with unlicensed operations, or through a combination of licensing and unlicensed operations. The FCC must seek public comment regarding these reports.  (Sec. 6) Before 2017, the FCC must take action in its Program Alternatives for Small Wireless Communications Facility Deployments proceeding. (Sec. 7) The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 is amended to require executive agencies, within 270 days after receiving an application, to grant or deny easements, rights-of-way, or leases to, in, over, or on federal property to install, construct, modify, or maintain a communications facility installation. Executive agencies must: (1) notify applicants of the reasons for denials, and (2) designate an agency point of contact for applicants. The bill expands the categories of infrastructure, antennas, wiring, and wireless transmission equipment for which applicants may seek such easements, rights-of-way, or leases. The NTIA must coordinate with the Departments of the Interior, Agriculture, Defense, and Transportation (DOT), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the General Services Administration to develop recommendations for tracking and expediting such applications. (Sec. 8) To facilitate installation of broadband infrastructure, DOT must ensure that states receiving federal-aid highway funds: (1) identify a broadband utility coordinator to coordinate the broadband infrastructure right-of-way needs of the state with federal-aid highway projects, (2) register broadband infrastructure entities that seek to be included in those coordination efforts, (3) coordinate statewide telecommunication and broadband plans and state and local transportation and land use plans, (4) provide strategies to minimize repeated excavations, and (5) ensure that any existing broadband infrastructure entities are not disadvantaged. (Sec. 9) The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) must establish a single database of real property owned, leased, or managed by executive agencies that is capable of supporting a communications facility installation. The OSTP must make the database available to: (1) entities that construct or operate communications facility installations or provide communications service, and (2) state and local governments so that they may provide information regarding state and local properties to include in the database. The OSTP must report to Congress regarding potential ways to incentivize state and local governments to provide such information. (Sec. 10) After notice and an opportunity for public comment, Commerce must submit recommendations to incentivize federal entities to relinquish, or share with federal or nonfederal users, federal spectrum for commercial wireless broadband services. It must consider whether permitting eligible federal entities to accept payments could expedite access to eligible frequencies. (Sec. 11) The FCC must collaborate with the NTIA to determine the best means of providing federal entities flexible access to nonfederal spectrum on a shared basis across a range of short-, mid-, and long-range timeframes, including for intermittent purposes like emergency use. (Sec. 12) After public notice and comment, the FCC must adopt rules that permit unlicensed services to use guard bands designated to protect frequencies allocated by competitive bidding if it would not cause harmful interference.  (Sec. 13) The OMB may provide pre-auction funding to federal agencies for auctions intended to occur within eight years (currently, five years) after the transfer of funds.  (Sec. 14) Federal entities may request an immediate transfer of funds to pay for relocation or sharing costs after the frequencies are reallocated by competitive bidding. (Sec. 15) The FCC must provide notice and an opportunity for public comment before it submits reports regarding: (1) the results of rule changes relating to the frequencies between 3550 and 3650 megahertz, and (2) proposals to promote and identify additional spectrum bands that can be shared between incumbent uses and new licensed and unlicensed services under such rules and that identify at least 1 gigahertz between 6 and 57 gigahertz for such use. (Sec. 16) The Government Accountability Office must recommend policies to increase the availability of broadband Internet access using unlicensed spectrum and wireless networks in low-income neighborhoods, particularly for elementary and school-aged children. (Sec. 17) The FCC must assess whether to establish a program, or modify existing programs, under which a licensee that receives a license for the exclusive use of spectrum in a specific geographic area may partition or disaggregate the license by sale or long-term lease to provide services consistent with the license and make unused spectrum available to: (1) unaffiliated small carriers with not more than 1,500 employees, or (2) other unaffiliated carriers to serve rural areas. (Sec. 18) The bill declares that it is U.S. policy to: (1) maximize U.S. spectrum resources to benefit U.S. people, (2) advance wireless broadband innovation and investment, and (3) make available on an unlicensed basis radio frequency bands sufficient to meet consumer demand. The FCC must ensure that its spectrum allocation and assignment efforts make available on an unlicensed basis radio frequency bands sufficient to meet demand for unlicensed wireless broadband operations if doing so is reasonable and in the public interest after taking into account the future needs of other spectrum users. (Sec. 19) The FCC must develop a national plan for making additional radio frequency bands available for unlicensed operations. The NTIA must recommend reforms to the Spectrum Relocation Fund to address federal entities' sharing costs and expenditures under the plan. (Sec. 20) The NTIA must conduct prize competitions to accelerate the development and commercialization of technology that improves spectrum efficiency and is capable of cost-effective deployment.  Not more than $5 million, in the aggregate, may be awarded to prize competition winners.  The FCC must publish a technical paper providing criteria that may be used for the design of such competitions. Wireless Telecommunications Tax and Fee Collection Fairness Act of 2016 (Sec. 21) State and local jurisdictions are prohibited from requiring a person to collect from, or remit on behalf of, any other person a state or local tax, fee, or surcharge imposed on the purchase or use of any wireless telecommunications service within the state unless the collection or remittance is in connection with a financial transaction between: (1) the person that the state or local jurisdiction requires to collect or remit the tax, fee, or surcharge; and (2) the purchaser or user of the wireless telecommunications service.

The expanded summary of the House passed version is repeated here.) Foreign Cultural Exchange Jurisdictional Immunity Clarification Act (Sec. 2) This bill amends the federal judicial code with respect to denial of a foreign state's sovereign immunity from the jurisdiction of U.S. or state courts in commercial activity cases where rights in property taken in violation of international law are in issue and that property, or any property exchanged for it, is: (1) present in the United States in connection with a commercial activity carried on by the foreign state in the United States, or (2) owned by an agency or instrumentality of the foreign state and that agency or instrumentality is engaged in a commercial activity in the United States. The bill grants a foreign state or certain carriers immunity from federal or state court jurisdiction for any activity in the United States associated with a temporary exhibition or display of a work of art or other object of cultural significance if:   the work of art or other object of cultural significance is imported into the United States from any foreign country pursuant to an agreement for its temporary exhibition or display between a foreign state that is its owner or custodian and the United States or U.S. cultural or educational institutions; and  the President has determined that such work is culturally significant and its temporary exhibition or display is in the national interest.   The bill denies immunity, however, in cases concerning rights in property taken in violation of international law in which the action is based upon a claim that the work was taken: (1) between January 30, 1933, and May 8, 1945, by the government of Germany or any government in Europe occupied, assisted, or allied by the German government; or (2) after 1900 in connection with the acts of a foreign government as part of a systematic campaign of coercive confiscation or misappropriation of works from members of a targeted and vulnerable group. For purposes of these denials of immunity, the court must determine that the activity associated with the exhibition or display is commercial and that determination must be necessary for the court to exercise jurisdiction over the foreign state.

The expanded summary of the House passed version is repeated here.)  Inspector General Empowerment Act of 2016 (Sec. 2) This bill amends the Inspector General Act of 1978 to exempt inspectors general (when they are conducting an authorized audit, investigation, inspection, evaluation, or review) from: (1) information privacy protections that require agreements between agencies for computerized comparisons of automated federal records systems under the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988, and (2) procedural requirements for information collections under the Paperwork Reduction Act. (Sec. 3) The Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) must submit to Congress an annual report that it currently submits only to the President.  CIGIE must mediate disputes regarding an audit, investigation, inspection, evaluation, or project that involves the jurisdiction of more than one office of inspector general, except for matters coordinated by intelligence community inspectors general. The membership structure of CIGIE's Integrity Committee is modified to eliminate: (1) the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as chairperson of the committee, and (2) the Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) as a committee member. The committee must elect one of the inspectors general on the committee as chairperson to serve for a term of two years.  Within seven days after the committee receives an allegation of wrongdoing against an inspector general or a staff member of an inspector general's office, the committee must refer such allegation to: (1) the Department of Justice (DOJ) or the OSC for investigation, or (2) the committee for review. If an allegation of wrongdoing is referred to the committee, the committee must decide within 30 days whether to refer the allegation to the chairperson to initiate an investigation. The 30-day period may be extended if the committee notifies Congress. The bill revises procedures for investigations of allegations of wrongdoing to: (1) require the committee chairperson to complete the investigation of referred allegations within 150 days after the committee's referral; (2) allow concurrent investigations by the committee, DOJ, and the OSC; and (3) require the committee's investigation reports and recommendations to be made available to Congress.  The committee may also receive, review, and refer allegations of wrongdoing against the Special Counsel or Deputy Special Counsel (officials appointed to investigate prohibited personnel practices and government waste and abuse).  (Sec. 4) The Government Accountability Office must report on prolonged vacancies in inspectors general offices. CIGIE must report on its analysis of critical issues that involve the jurisdiction of more than one office of inspector general to identify best practices and issues for increased coordination among inspectors general offices. The semiannual reports that inspectors general submit to their agencies and Congress must include:   a summary of audit, inspection, and evaluation reports for which an inspector general's agency did not return a comment and for which there are outstanding unimplemented recommendations, including the aggregate potential cost savings of those recommendations;  statistical tables and metrics showing the total number of issued investigative reports, referrals to prosecuting authorities for criminal prosecution, and indictments from prior referrals;  a report on each investigation involving a senior government employee where allegations of misconduct were substantiated;  descriptions of any whistle-blower retaliation, investigations that were closed and were not disclosed to the public, or attempts by an agency to interfere with inspector general independence, including through budget constraints, resistance to oversight, or delayed information access.  Inspectors general are prohibited from providing Congress or the public with any information through such semiannual reports that would reveal the personally identifiable information of a whistle-blower without the whistle-blower's consent.  Inspectors general must submit their recommendations for corrective action to: (1) the head of their agency, (2) the congressional committees of jurisdiction, and (3) any individual or entity requesting the corrective action if the recommendation was initiated by request. The document making the recommendation must also be posted on the inspector general's website.  (Sec. 5) The bill sets forth standards regarding inspectors general access to agency records, the timeliness of their access, and procedures for their requests for access to federal grand jury materials.  An inspector general may access federal grand jury materials that are protected from disclosure under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure by submitting a request to the head of his or her establishment, who must then transmit the request to DOJ. DOJ must grant such a request unless access to the grand jury materials would: (1) interfere with an ongoing criminal investigation, prosecution, or undercover operation; (2) identify a confidential source or protected witness; (3) pose a serious threat to national security; or (4) significantly impair the trade or economic interests of the United States. If DOJ denies such a request, it must submit a statement to Congress explaining the reason for the denial. The DOJ Inspector General is exempt from these request procedures and shall automatically have access to information available to DOJ regarding grand jury materials. (Sec. 6) The Attorney General or the Secretaries of Defense, the Treasury, Homeland Security, or Energy may prohibit inspectors general from accessing certain sensitive or national security information.", "summary_short": "(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced.

This list shall also be provided to each federal agency for review and for making recommendations for collocations.  The bill establishes a Federal Real Property Council, to be chaired by the Deputy Director for Management of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to: (1) develop guidance and ensure implementation of an efficient and effective real property management strategy, (2) identify opportunities for the federal government to better manage its property and assets, and (3) reduce the costs of managing federal properties.  The council must update annually a real property management plan template with government-wide performance measures to reduce surplus property or achieve better utilization of underutilized property. The evaluation criteria must: (1) enable Congress and federal agencies to track their progress on a government-wide basis, and (2) allow for comparison of the performance of federal agencies against industry and other public sector agencies. The council must: (1) develop utilization rates consistent throughout each category of space and consistent with nongovernmental space use rates, (2) develop a strategy to reduce the reliance of federal agencies on leased space for long-term needs if ownership would be less costly, (3) provide guidance on eliminating inefficiencies in the federal leasing process, (4) compile a list of field offices suitable for collocation, and (5) develop guidelines for the use of public-private partnerships in the management of federal property. For five years, the council must report annually to the OMB on: (1) a list of the remaining excess property that is real property, surplus property that is real property, and underutilized property of each federal agency; (2) the council's progress in developing guidelines for agencies to assess their properties; (3) the progress of agencies in reducing excess and underutilized real property; (4) legislative recommendations; and (5) a list of entities that are consulted. The council must consult with: (1) state, local, and tribal authorities and other affected communities; and (2) private sector and nongovernmental organizations with expertise in transportation, commercial real estate, historic preservation, and homeless housing. The council must annually provide the real property management plan template and required reports to specified congressional committees and the Government Accountability Office. Federal agencies with independent leasing authority shall annually submit to the council a list of all leases currently in effect. This requirement shall not apply to the USPS or any other property excluded for national security reasons.  (Sec. 4) The USPS shall: (1) maintain adequate inventory controls and accountability systems for postal properties, and (2) develop workforce projections to assess the property-related needs of the USPS workforce.  The USPS may develop a five-year management template to: (1) reduce excess and underutilized property; (2) adopt workplace practices, configurations, and management techniques that decrease the need for real property assets; (3) identify leased space that is not fully used or occupied; and (4) secure mail processing operations.  If the USPS develops such template, it shall conduct on a regular basis and report on an inventory of postal property that is real property. (Sec. 5) The USPS inspector general must report on excess property held by the USPS and recommendations for repurposing such property and increasing collocation with other federal agencies.  (Sec. 6) The bill expands the duties of federal agencies, with respect to the use of federal real property, to require: (1) workforce projections to assess the property-related requirements of the federal workforce, (2) the establishment of goals and priorities to reduce excess and underutilized property, (3) assessments of leased space to identify space that is not fully used or occupied, and (4) an annual inventory of real property under agency control and an assessment of the condition of such property.  (Sec. 7) The bill amends the Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act to: (1) require the President to appoint specified members of the Public Buildings Reform Board recommended by (currently in consultation with) the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the majority leader of the Senate, and the the minority leaders of the House and the Senate; and (2) require the sale by the General Services Administration of specified property in southwest Washington, D.C., to ensure continuity of security measures, parking access, and infrastructure requirements of the James Forrestal Building while it is occupied by the Department of Energy.", "summary_short": "(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced.

For the purposes of such provision a \"deceased individual\" is an individual who: (1) served in the Armed Forces on or after April 6, 1917; and (2) is eligible for a headstone or marker or who would be eligible but for his or her date of death. The VA shall furnish at a private cemetery, upon request, a headstone, marker, or medallion that signifies the status of an eligible veteran who served in the Armed Forces on or after April 6, 1917, as a Medal of Honor recipient. If the VA furnished a headstone, marker, or medallion for a deceased veteran that does not signify his or her status as a Medal of Honor recipient, the VA shall, upon request, replace that headstone, marker, or medallion with one that signifies the deceased's status as a Medal of Honor recipient.

(Under current law, surviving spouses of service members who die in the line of duty after September 11, 2001, are eligible for such assistance until the earlier of the date they remarry or the date that is 15 years after the military spouse's death.) A surviving spouse of a member of the Armed Forces who died between September 11, 2001, and December 31, 2005, who elected before enactment of this bill to receive educational benefits under the Survivors and Dependents Educational Assistance program or the Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry program may revoke such choice.

Post-9/11 program eligibility shall be conditioned on an individual's meeting program requirements as of the date of election. The bill prescribes transitional rules with respect to the transfer or revocation of entitlements from a previous assistance program after an election to convert to the Post-9/11 program. Certain assistance shall remain available to individuals under their previous program if it is not available under the Post-9/11 program. After January 1, 2017, if an individual submits an election that the VA determines is against the individual's interests, the VA may make an alternative election on the individual's behalf. Such an individual may, during a specified period, modify or revoke the VA's alternative selection. (Sec. 406) The period for certain qualifying work-study activities for individuals receiving VA educational assistance is extended through June 30, 2022. (Sec. 407) The bill permits centralized reporting of veterans enrollment by a group, district, or consortium of separately accredited educational institutions located in the same state. (Sec. 408) Specified education programs are deemed to be approved for veterans' education benefit purposes if a state approving agency determines that they qualify. A state approving agency, or the VA acting in the role of a state approving agency, may approve other accredited programs for such purposes. (Sec. 409) The bill revises licensure or certification program requirements necessary for VA approval. (Sec. 410) State approving agencies may continue to establish additional criteria for the approval of nonaccredited courses, but the VA must, in consultation with the state approving agency, determine that such criteria are necessary and treat public, private, and proprietary for-profit educational institutions equitably. (Sec. 411) The VA shall conduct an annual compliance survey of educational institutions and training establishments offering one or more courses approved for the enrollment of eligible veterans or persons if at least 20 such veterans or persons are enrolled in any such course.

Each educational institution and training establishment shall be surveyed at lease once every two years. (Sec. 412) The rates of the reporting fees that are paid to educational institutions for each educational assistance beneficiary are revised for the periods ending: (1) September 25, 2017, and (2) September 25, 2026. (Sec. 413) The bill revises the requirements of the composition of the Veterans Advisory Committee on Education.

(Sec. 502) The Department of Labor shall contract with a non-government entity to conduct a five-year study of veterans' job counseling, training, and placement services. (Sec. 503) The VA may not place an employee on administrative leave or any other type of paid non-duty status for more than a total of 14 days during any 365-day period.

TITLE VI--HEALTH CARE MATTERS Subtitle A--Medical Care (Sec. 601) The bill provides advanced appropriations for the VA Medical Community Care account. (Sec. 602) The bill includes in VA preventive health services immunizations against infectious diseases, including each immunization on the recommended adult immunization schedule established by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.

In investigating a complaint, DOJ may coordinate activities with entities that DOJ determines to be appropriate.  DOJ may reopen and review cases closed without an in-person investigation conducted by DOJ or the FBI. DOJ must hold meetings with the Civil Rights Division, the FBI, the Community Relations Service, civil rights organizations, institutions of higher education, DOJ-designated entities, and state and local law enforcement to discuss the status of its Emmett Till Act work. In an annual report to Congress, DOJ must indicate:   the number of cases referred by a civil rights organization, an institution of higher education, or a state or local law enforcement agency;  the number of such cases that resulted in federal charges;  the date any such charges were filed;  whether DOJ has declined to prosecute or participate in an investigation of a referred case;  the outreach, collaboration, and support for investigations and prosecutions of violations of criminal civil rights statutes, including murders and disappearances; and  any activity on reopened cases.   The Community Relations Service must provide technical assistance by bringing together law enforcement agencies and communities to address tensions raised by civil rights era crimes.", "summary_short": "(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the House on December 7, 2016.

Justice for All Reauthorization Act of 2016 (Sec. 2) This bill amends the federal criminal code to require a court to order, as an explicit condition of supervised release, that a defendant makes restitution to the victim of a federal offense for which restitution is authorized. A defendant's liability to pay restitution terminates 20 years from the filing date of the judgment or the defendant's release from prison. In the event of the death of the person ordered to pay restitution, the individual's estate will be held responsible. The bill amends Rule 28 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to authorize a court to appoint and compensate an interpreter for a crime victim. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) must study and report to Congress on whether providing broader authority for courts to award restitution would benefit crime victims.

DOJ must coordinate with the Department of Health and Human Services to inform federally qualified health centers, hospitals, colleges and universities, and other health-related entities about the role of forensic nurses and the resources available to train or employ them. (Sec. 5) This section amends the Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 to specify that funds under the STOP (Services, Training, Officers, and Prosecutors) Violence Against Women Formula Grant Program are not subject to a 5% reduction for a state that fails to comply with the national prison rape standards. (Sec. 6) The bill amends the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 to specify that accommodations applicable to a remaining tenant, after the eviction of the sole tenant eligible to receive assistance under a covered housing program, also apply to a resident. (Sec. 7) The bill revises and expands requirements with respect to adopting national prison rape standards. Specifically, it requires states to also provide certain additional information.  Additionally, it requires compliance auditors to submit to criminal history background checks.

It revises existing purpose areas to specify that, with respect to eliminating a backlog in analyzing forensic science evidence: (1) forensic science evidence includes impression evidence, digital evidence, and fire evidence; and (2) medicolegal death investigators may be trained and employed. It also adds new purpose areas to address emerging forensic science issues and technology, educate and train forensic pathologists, and fund medicolegal death investigation systems. A Coverdell grant recipient must include, in its annual report, the progress of an unaccredited forensic science service provider in obtaining accreditation.  (Sec. 10) This section amends the Innocence Protection Act of 2004 to reauthorize through FY2021 the Capital Representation Improvement Grant Program (i.e., the grant program to improve the quality of legal representation for indigent criminal defendants in death penalty cases). (Sec. 11) This section amends the federal criminal code to specify that if a court-ordered DNA test excludes a defendant as the DNA source and meets other requirements, then the DNA profile must be submitted to the National DNA Index System to identify matching profiles of known individuals or profiles from unsolved crimes.  Additionally, it revises the applicability of the requirement to preserve biological evidence in the federal investigation or prosecution of a defendant who was sentenced to prison. (Sec. 12) It reauthorizes through FY2021 the Kirk Bloodsworth Post-Conviction DNA Testing Grant Program.  (Sec. 13) This section directs the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) to establish best practices for evidence retention that focus on preserving forensic evidence. The NIJ must assist state, local, and tribal governments to adopt and implement such best practices. Effective Administration of Criminal Justice Act of 2016 (Sec. 14) The bill amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to require an application for funds under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program to include a statewide strategic plan to improve the administration criminal justice. It requires DOJ to provide technical assistance and authorizes FY2017-FY2021 appropriations for such technical assistance. (Sec. 15) The DOJ Office of Inspector General must conduct annual audits of selected grant recipients.  The bill prohibits DOJ from awarding grants to nonprofit organizations that hold money in an offshore account to avoid tax liability. It also prohibits DOJ from using more than 7.5% of the amount authorized for salaries and administrative expenses. It limits the use of grant funds for conferences that use more than $20,000 in DOJ funds. It prohibits a grantee from using grant funds to lobby DOJ or a state, local, or tribal government regarding the award of grant funding.  DOJ must identify and report on duplicative grant awards. (Sec. 16) DOJ must study and report to Congress on the status and needs of the forensic science community. (Sec. 17) It amends the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 to authorize DOJ's Office for Victims of Crimes (OVC) to use discretionary funds for victim services. It expresses the sense of Congress that the proposed rule entitled \"VOCA Victim Assistance Program\" is consistent with the OVC's Victim Assistance Program. (Sec. 18) DOJ must evaluate the performance of U.S. Attorneys offices and DOJ component offices in seeking and recovering restitution under each provision of the federal criminal code and the Controlled Substances Act that authorizes it.

(Sec. 703) The Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 is amended to permit Radio Free Asia to broadcast in the whole of Asia. (Currently, broadcasting is limited to China, Burma, Cambodia, Laos, North Korea, Tibet, and Vietnam.) The bill prohibits any change to the federal status of the Cuba Service or the Television Marti Service unless such service's establishing provision is repealed and such service is dissolved by an Act of Congress.  It is the sense of Congress that the Broadcasting Board of Governors should start broadcasting in the Sindhi language. (Sec. 704) The bill allows payment of a reward to an individual who provides information leading to the arrest or conviction of any foreign national accused of aiding or abetting the commission of war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide or of preventing efforts to apprehend a foreign national accused of such activities. It is the sense of Congress that the refusal by other countries to extradite or otherwise render to the United States fugitives who have been indicted or convicted within the United States for serious crimes, including murder, hijacking, and acts of domestic terrorism, is an impediment to justice, undermines international security, and deserves high level diplomatic efforts toward resolution.  The President shall brief Congress regarding the number of fugitives for whom the United States is seeking extradition or rendition. (Sec. 705) The Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 is amended to extend to October 1, 2018, the State Department's authority to reimburse fishermen for the fines and direct costs incurred from the illegal foreign seizure and detention of a U.S.-flagged fishing vessel. (Sec. 706) Beginning in FY 2017, the State Department shall: (1) increase by 10 the number of fellows selected for the Charles B.

(Sec. 714) It is the sense of Congress that the State Department should ensure that its overseas employees' health coverage provides access for dependents with autism spectrum disorder. (Sec. 715) The bill repeals, and makes revisions to, specified reporting requirements. (Sec. 716) No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this bill.

(Sec. 1102) The Corps of Engineers must use its existing channel depths and dimensions authority under the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1915 to carry out navigation safety activities at harbor or inland harbor projects eligible for Corps operation and maintenance under the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (WRDA 1986), including at entrances, bends, sidings, and turning places necessary for the free movement of boats. (Sec. 1103) The bill makes permanent a requirement under WRDA 1986 that the Corps of Engineers use at least 10% (currently, exactly 10%) of the difference between the funds made available for a fiscal year to pay operations and maintenance costs of harbors and inland harbors and the funds that were available for such costs for FY2012 as priority funding for emerging harbor projects that transit less than 1 million tons of cargo annually. (Sec. 1104) The Corps of Engineers must report on its inventory and assessment of the structural condition of all federal breakwaters and jetties protecting harbors and inland harbors.  (Sec. 1105) The Water Resources Development Act of 2007 (WRDA 2007) is amended to require the Corps of Engineers to consider regional (currently, local) communities when it makes recommendations for harbor and navigation improvements that are not justified solely by national economic development benefits. (Sec. 1106) The Corps of Engineers may enter agreements to assume the operation and maintenance costs of an alternative project to maintenance dredging for a federal navigation channel if the costs of the operation and maintenance of the alternative project, and any remaining costs necessary for maintaining the federal navigation channel, are less than the costs of maintaining such channel without the alternative project.  (Sec. 1107) The bill makes permanent the Corps of Engineers' authority to use available priority funds (the difference between funds made available for operations and maintenance costs assigned to commercial navigation of harbors under WRDA 1986 each fiscal year and those funds made available for FY2012) for underserved harbors and projects within the Great Lakes Navigation System.  (Sec. 1108) If the target total budget resources available to the Corps of Engineers from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) for a fiscal year is lower than the resources for the previous fiscal year, the target shall be adjusted to be the lesser of: (1) 103% of the total appropriated for the previous fiscal year, or (2) 100% of the harbor maintenance taxes received in the previous fiscal year. (Sec. 1109) The Corps of Engineers may maintain federally authorized harbors of refuge to restore and maintain authorized dimensions. (Sec. 1110) The bill amends the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (WRRDA 2014) to revise the payment allocations to donor ports and energy transfer ports through the establishment of a new category of medium-sized donor ports that are eligible for funding if they annually collect between $5 million and $15 million of total HMTF funding (donor ports must currently collect at least $15 million annually to be eligible).  The bill modifies the method of transferring through the U.S. Customs and Border Protection payments that ports may currently elect to provide to importers or shippers. The new process: (1) excludes shippers from being eligible recipients of such payments, and (2) requires payment calculations by the Corps of Engineers based on discretionary cargo (maritime cargo for which the U.S. port of unlading is different than the U.S. port of entry) that is shipped through the ports and that is most at risk of diversion to seaports outside the United States. The Corps of Engineers must determine the top importers at a port electing to provide such payments, as ranked by value of discretionary cargo, and payments shall be limited to those top importers.  The bill extends through FY2020, or through FY2025 if target total budget resources are met, the authorization for funding to such donor ports, medium-sized donor ports, and energy transfer ports for: (1) payments to importers, (2) maintenance dredging that benefits commercial navigation at harbors, or (3) environmental remediation related to dredging berths and federal navigation channels.  (Sec. 1111) The bill extends to contracts for physical construction that have not been awarded before enactment of WRRDA 2014 the formula that calculates the harbor deepening costs to be paid by nonfederal interests during construction for harbor or inland harbor navigation projects. For the portion of a project that has a depth in excess of 45 feet but not in excess of 50 feet, the cost to be paid by nonfederal interests is decreased from 50% to 25% of the cost of construction for that portion. (Sec. 1112) The Corps of Engineers must publish guidance for the implementation of WRRDA 2014 provisions concerning maintenance of emerging ports and Great Lakes ports. (Sec. 1113) The Corps of Engineers may permit a nonfederal interest to carry out maintenance activities necessary to ensure that a navigation project is maintained to not less than the minimum project dimensions. Costs incurred by the nonfederal interest are eligible for reimbursement up to the estimated federal cost, but are limited to costs directly related to the performance of work for the federal government and the actual fiscal year appropriations for that portion of maintenance dredging. Any reimbursement is subject to the nonfederal interest complying with all federal laws and regulations that would apply if such maintenance activities were carried out by the Corps.  In carrying out the maintenance activities, the nonfederal interest shall: (1) provide equipment at no cost to the federal government, and (2) hold the United States free from damages that arise from the use of the equipment. This section terminates 10 years after enactment of this bill.  (Sec. 1114) The Corps of Engineers' next biennial HMTF report on operations and maintenance costs assigned to commercial navigation of harbors and inland harbors must identify transportation cost savings realized by achieving and maintaining the constructed width and depth for such harbors on a project-by-project basis. This requirement does not apply to subsequent reports. (Sec. 1115) The Corps of Engineers must establish a pilot program to accept services from nonfederal interests or commercial entities for removal of sediment captured behind up to 10 U.S. dams under Corps jurisdiction for the purpose of restoring authorized storage capacity. The nonfederal interests or commercial entities may sell or otherwise dispose of the removed sediment without compensating the Corps for the sediment's value. (Sec. 1116) In a state in which a drought emergency has been declared or was in effect during the year before enactment of this bill, the Corps of Engineers may enter agreements with nonfederal interests to carry out approved water supply conservation measures. (Sec. 1117) Upon the request of a governor of a state with a drought emergency during the year leading up to the enactment of this bill, the Corps of Engineers may prioritize updates of water control manuals and incorporate seasonal operations for water conservation and water supply for control structures. (Sec. 1118) The Corps of Engineers, at a nonfederal interest's request, may review proposals to increase the quantity of available water supplies at federal water resources development projects through: (1) modification of the project, (2) modification of how a project is managed, or (3) access to water released from a project. But this section shall not apply to proposals that: (1) reallocate existing water supply or hydropower storage, or (2) reduce water available for any authorized project purpose. If a proposal relates to a federal project that is not operated by the Corps of Engineers, this section applies only to activities under the Corps' authority. The Corps of Engineers must comply with public participation requirements and provide a copy of proposals to federal agencies that operate a project, affected states, power marketing administrations, and other entities with project rights or responsibilities. The Corps of Engineers shall not approve a proposal that: (1) is not supported by the federal agency that operates the project, (2) adversely impacts contractual or legal rights, (3) increases costs to other entities, (4) interferes with authorized project purposes, or (5) modifies federal statutory requirements without congressional authorization. The cost of developing, reviewing, and implementing a submitted proposal shall be provided by a nonfederal entity. But if an entity working with a state is authorized to receive the Corps of Engineers' assistance in the preparation of a comprehensive plan, the Corps may use those funds to pay 50% of the cost of the entity's proposal review.  Special requirements are set forth for operation and maintenance costs relating to the construction of additional water supply storage at a reservoir for use under a water supply storage agreement.  Other entities may contribute to the costs of implementing a proposal.  The Corps of Engineers may provide technical assistance for a proposal if the nonfederal interest agrees to pay the costs of the assistance.  This section shall not apply to reservoirs in the Upper Missouri River, the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint river system, the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa river system, or the Stones River. (Sec. 1119) For federally recognized Indian tribes, local cost-sharing requirements for studies and projects are waived up to a specified amount. (Sec. 1120) The Corps of Engineers must submit to Congress: (1) the Tribal Consultation Policy reports that it currently submits to the Office of Management and Budget; and (2) a report on its review of existing policies, regulations, and guidance related to consultation with Indian tribes that may have an impact on tribal cultural or natural resources.  (Sec. 1121) The Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (WRDA 2000) is amended to allow the Corps of Engineers to carry out cost-shared design and construction of water resources development projects under the tribal partnership program. At an Indian tribe's request, the Corps of Engineers must report on the feasibility of a water resources development project that will substantially benefit Indian tribes.  The Corps of Engineers may carry out the design and construction of a feasible tribal partnership project if: (1) the federal share is not more than $10 million, or (2) congressional authorization is obtained for a federal share exceeding $10 million. The Corps of Engineers is prohibited from requiring an Indian tribe to waive its sovereign immunity as a condition to entering into a cost-sharing agreement under the tribal partnership program. The bill sets forth the nonfederal cost shares for studies, design and construction, and watershed and river basin assessments under the expanded program. (Sec. 1122) The Corps of Engineers must establish a pilot program to carry out 10 cost-sharing projects for the beneficial use of dredged material. Project selections must be based solely on: (1) environmental, economic, and social benefits; and (2) diversity in project types and geographical locations. The projects are exempt from federal standards that require dredged material disposals representing the least costly alternatives. Regional teams that include local agencies and stakeholders must be established to identify and assist in implementation of projects. The Corps of Engineers may use sediment from other federal and nonfederal sources, but any nonfederal source sediment must be obtained without federal expense. Federal water resources projects involving the disposal of dredged material may include a single or periodic application of sediment for beneficial use and shall not require operation and maintenance. The Corps may accept funds from a nonfederal interest to dispose of such dredged material for private shores or lands that are ineligible for federal cost sharing. (Sec. 1123) The bill repeals provisions of WRDA 2000 concerning the authorization of appropriations for Great Lakes fishery and ecosystem restoration plans and projects.  (Sec. 1124) A Corps of Engineers coordinator and principal approving official must be designated to acquire Federal Aviation Administration authorizations for the Corps to operate small unmanned aircraft systems (drones) to support civil works and emergency response missions. (Sec. 1125) The Corps of Engineers may accept funds from a railroad carrier to expedite the evaluation of the carrier's permits for a project under the Corps' jurisdiction. (Currently, the Corps may accept such funds from only public utility or natural gas companies to expedite such a permit.) The Corps' authority to accept such contributions for expedited permit processing is extended through June 10, 2024. (Sec. 1126) The Corps of Engineers may provide technical assistance to nonfederal interests for feasibility studies of a proposed water resources development project if the nonfederal interest contracts to pay the costs of such assistance.  (Sec. 1127) The Corps of Engineers may authorize credits or reimbursements for discrete segments of a flood reduction project under WRDA 1986 before final completion of the project if the nonfederal interest can independently operate and maintain the segment without creating a hazard in advance of project completion. (Sec. 1128) The Corps of Engineers may cooperate with groups of states to prepare comprehensive plans for the development, utilization, and conservation of the water and related resources of drainage basins, watersheds, or ecosystems located within their boundaries. States may combine funds that the Corps makes available to them for such purposes. (Sec. 1129) The cost-share assistance under the Water Resources Development Act of 1974 that is provided to Indian tribes, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Marianas, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands to prepare comprehensive plans for the development, utilization, and conservation of the water and related resources of drainage basins, watersheds, or ecosystems shall be as provided under the local cost-sharing waivers for U.S. territories under WRDA 1986. (Sec. 1130) State regional districts' flood damage reduction projects are eligible for assistance from: (1) the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to establish a levee safety program, and (2) the Corps of Engineers for flood mitigation activities. The national levee database, inventory and review procedures, and safety guidelines must be updated to include regional district participation. (Sec. 1131) The categories of \"nonfederal interests\" under the Flood Control Act of 1970 are expanded to include Alaska native villages, regional corporations, and village corporations among the entities that may enter partnership agreements with the Corps for implementation or construction of water resources projects. (Sec. 1132) The Corps of Engineers' post-authorization change reports recommending modifications to authorized projects: (1) may not be delayed by policy or priority change considerations, and (2) must be submitted to Congress upon completion. (Sec. 1133) The Corps of Engineers must establish a publicly available database on its dredging projects, including information on maintenance dredging carried out by federal and nonfederal vessels. For each project and contract, the database must include estimated and actual data on the number of private contractor bids received and the bid amounts. (Sec. 1134) The Corps of Engineers' system for electronic submission of permit applications must: (1) allow applicants to prepare permit applications, request jurisdictional determinations, and track their status electronically; and (2) address joint applications for state and federal permits. The Corps must maintain records of each permit decision and jurisdictional determination for at least five years and then archive those records.  (Sec. 1135) The Corps of Engineers must publish data on: (1) the planning, design, construction, operation, and maintenance of water resources development projects; and (2) water quality and water management of projects owned, operated, or managed by the Corps. But disclosure is not authorized for confidential or privileged information, law enforcement or national security information, infrastructure security information, or personal information. (Sec. 1136) Transmittal letters and attachments printed as House or Senate documents for certain proposed reports and recommendations transmitted to Congress for flood control or navigation improvements must be made publicly available.  The Corps of Engineers must provide the Library of Congress a copy of each final post-authorization change report for water resources projects.  (Sec. 1137) The Corps of Engineers must report on the amount of acquisitions it has made in the prior fiscal year for civil works projects from entities that manufactured the articles, materials, or supplies outside of the United States. The report must indicate dollar values and summarize total procurement funds spent on goods manufactured inside versus outside the United States for each category of acquisition.  (Sec. 1138) The Corps of Engineers' international outreach program is expanded to include informing the United States of technological innovations abroad that could improve any water resources development in the United States, including technology transfers or exchanges. (Under current law, the program is limited to informing the maritime industry and port authorities about innovations that could improve waterborne transportation.)

TITLE II--WATER AND WASTE ACT OF 2016 Water and Waste Act of 2016 Subtitle A--Safe Drinking Water (Sec. 2101) Urges Congress to provide robust funding of capitalization grants to states for the drinking water state revolving fund (DWSRF) and the clean water state revolving fund. (Sec. 2102) This bill allows public water systems to use financial assistance from the DWSRF for: (1) planning, design, and associated preconstruction activities, including activities related to the siting of the facility; and (2) meeting matching fund requirements. (Sec. 2103) It revises the requirements which govern the amount of money states may use for administering the DWSRF and providing technical assistance to public water systems. (Sec. 2104) The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must establish a grant program to provide assistance for public water systems in complying with the Safe Drinking Water Act if those systems serve communities that: (1) are disadvantaged; or (2) have populations of less than 10,000 individuals and do not have the capacity to incur debt sufficient to finance a DWSRF project. The bill makes Indian tribes eligible for the grant program. (Sec. 2105) The EPA must also establish a grant program for reducing the concentration of lead in drinking water by: (1) replacing publicly owned lead service lines, (2) identifying and addressing conditions that contribute to increased concentration of lead in drinking water, and (3) providing assistance to low-income homeowners to replace lead service lines. The bill makes Indian tribes eligible for the grant program. (Sec. 2106) This bill amends the Safe Drinking Water Act by requiring public water systems to notify their customers when a lead action level under national drinking water regulations is exceeded in more than 10% of customer taps sampled. An action level is generally a certain contaminant level that triggers a requirement for the public water system to take additional actions to control corrosion. Further, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must: (1) notify customers of an exceedance of the lead action level that has the potential to have serious adverse effects on human health as a result of short-term exposure, if the state or the public water system fails to notify the public within 24 hours after the public water system learns of the violation or exceedance; and (2) issue the notice no later than 24 hours of being notified of the exceedance. Community water systems' consumer confidence reports must include a definition of \"action level.\" The EPA must establish a strategic plan for conducting targeted outreach, education, technical assistance, and risk communication to populations affected by lead in the public water system.  EPA employees must forward to the public water system any data indicating that the drinking water of a household served by a public water system contains a level of lead that exceeds the lead action level. Information on the sampling techniques used to obtain the data must also be forwarded with the data. The public water system must then disseminate to affected households information on the exceedance of a lead limit, its potential adverse effects on human health, corrective steps underway, and advice on whether customers should seek alternative water supplies.  The EPA must disseminate the information if the public water system or the state fails to do so.

The Small Business Administration (SBA) shall continue through FY2022 to permit each federal agency to use up to 3% of its SBIR program funds to assist the agency in its required SBIR or STTR program's administration and related activities.  (Sec. 3) The bill also increases the percentages of required agency expenditures with small business concerns under these programs for each of those fiscal years. (Sec. 4) The bill revises SBIR and STTR annual reporting requirements to establish deadline dates. The SBA's annual report to Congress on these programs shall be due by December 31 of each year. Federal agency annual reports to the SBA on their SBIR or STTR program shall be due by March 30. The SBA must report annually to Congress by June 30 on the use of SBIR program funds by federal agencies for specified purposes in the Act.  (Sec. 5) SBA policy directives shall index SBIR and STTR awards for inflation. As under current law, an award for: (1) Phase I of an SBIR or STTR program may not exceed $150,000, and (2) Phase II of such program may not exceed $1 million. The SBA shall continue to adjust these dollar amounts for inflation.  (Sec. 6) This bill requires the Department of Defense (which under current law is already authorized) to create insertion incentives under the Department of Defense Commercialization Readiness Program for any contract with a value of at least $100 million to:  establish goals for the transition of Phase III technologies in subcontracting plans, and require a prime contractor on such a contract to report the number and dollar amount of contracts entered into by that prime contractor for Phase III SBIR or STTR projects.  (Sec. 7) The SBA shall modify its policy directives to make clear that HUBZone small business concerns owned and controlled by Alaska Native Corporations, owned by Indian tribal governments, and owned by Native Hawaiian Organizations are eligible to receive SBIR and STTR awards. (Sec. 8) Any federal agency required to have an SBIR program (covered agency) shall implement a commercialization assistance pilot program (CAPP) through FY2022 to award eligible entities with a second sequential SBIR award, unless the agency already has a program sufficiently similar to CAPP. A covered agency may spend up to 5% of its total SBIR budget for CAPP awards, to be distributed during the recipient's Phase II award period. Such awards may only be used for research and development activities that build on the eligible entity's Phase II program and catalyze acceleration towards commercialization. The SBA shall require as a condition of any CAPP award that an equal matching amount (excluding any fees collected from recipients of such assistance) be provided from an eligible third-party investor before the end of the CAPP award. An eligible entity may not use funding from ineligible sources to meet this matching requirement. The term:  \"eligible entity\" means a small business concern that has received a Phase II award and a Phase II sequential award from the covered agency to which such entity is applying for a second sequential SBIR award; \"eligible third-party investor\" means a small business concern other than the eligible entity, a venture capital firm, an individual investor, a non-SBIR federal, state, or local government, or any combination; and \"ineligible sources\" means the awardee's internal research and development funds, funding in forms other than cash such as in-kind or other intangible assets, funding from the owners of the eligible entity, or the family members or affiliates of such owners, or funding attained through loans or other forms of debt obligations.  (Sec. 9) The bill eliminates the authority of an agency to request a waiver of the requirement to use a portion of SBIR funds for outreach efforts to increase the participation of:  social and economically disadvantaged small business concerns and certain woman-owned small business concerns, and states in which a low level of SBIR awards have historically been awarded.

Wolf International Religious Freedom Act (Sec. 2) This bill expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) a foreign country's practice of routinely denying visa applications for religious workers can be indicative of a poor state of religious freedom in that country, and (2) the U.S. government should seek to reverse any such policy by reviewing the bilateral relationship between such country and the United States.  TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF STATE ACTIVITIES (Sec. 101) The International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (IRFA) is amended to provide that in order to promote religious freedom as a U.S. foreign policy interest, the Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom: (1) shall coordinate international religious freedom policies across all U.S. programs and activities, and (2) is urged to participate in any interagency processes in which the promotion of international religious freedom policy can advance U.S. national security interests.   It is the sense of Congress that maintaining an adequate staffing level at the Office of International Religious Freedom is necessary for the office to carry out its work. (Sec. 102) The deadline for submitting the Annual Report on International Religious Freedom is changed from September 1 to May 1 (or the first day thereafter on which the appropriate House of Congress is in session).  Such report shall include information about:    severe violations of religious freedom in a country where a government does not function or does not control its territory;   identification of prisoners in a country;  action taken by a government to censor religious content, communications, or worship activities online; persecution of human rights advocates seeking to defend the rights of members of religious groups or highlight religious freedom violations, including prohibitions on ritual animal slaughter or male infant circumcision; and  country-specific analysis of the impact of U.S. actions on religious freedom.   The executive summary of each such report shall include information about a country in which a non-state actor is designated as an entity of particular concern for religious freedom.  The bill expresses the sense of Congress that given that the annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices no longer contain updated information on religious freedom conditions globally, it is important that the Department of State coordinates with the Commission on International Religious Freedom to fulfill IRFA's original intent.  (Sec. 103) The Foreign Service Act of 1980 is amended to require the Director of the George P. Shultz National Foreign Affairs Training Center to conduct training on religious freedom for all Foreign Service officers and all outgoing deputy chiefs of mission and ambassadors. The State Department shall submit a plan within 180 days for undertaking such training. Such curriculum and training materials shall be shared with the Armed Forces and other federal agencies with overseas personnel. (Sec. 104) The commission shall make publicly available lists of persons who are imprisoned, detained, disappeared, placed under house arrest, tortured, or subject to forced renunciations of religious faith by the government of a foreign country or by a non-state actor that the commission recommends for designation as a country or entity of particular concern for religious freedom.  TITLE II--NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL (Sec. 201) The Special Adviser to the President on International Religious Freedom is urged to assist the Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom to coordinate executive branch international religious freedom policies and strategies throughout the executive branch and within any interagency policy committee of which the Ambassador at Large is a member.  TITLE III--PRESIDENTIAL ACTIONS (Sec. 301) The President: (1) concurrent with the annual review of the status of religious freedom in foreign countries required under the IFRA, shall identify any non-state actors operating in a reviewed country or surrounding region that have engaged in particularly severe violations of religious freedom; (2) shall designate each such non-state actor as an entity of particular concern for religious freedom; (3) shall submit a report detailing the reasons for such designation; and (4) is urged to take specific actions against such non-state actors. The bill expresses the sense of Congress that the State Department should work with Congress to create new political, financial, and diplomatic tools to address severe violations of religious freedom by non-state actors.   The President shall, with respect to each non-state actor designated as an entity of particular concern for religious freedom, determine the specific officials or members who are responsible for such violations.  (Sec. 302) The deadline for such annual review is changed from September 1 to not later than 90 days after a review is submitted.  (Sec. 303) The President's report on action taken in response to violations of religious freedom or on designation of a country as a country of particular concern for religious freedom shall include: (1) an evaluation of the impact on the advancement of U.S. interests in democracy, human rights, and security; and (2) a description of policy tools being applied in the country, including programs that target democratic stability, economic growth, and counter-terrorism. (Sec. 304) The waiver of specified presidential actions subsequent to the designation of a country as a country of particular concern for religious freedom is limited to 180 days. The bill prescribes additional presidential waiver authority after such 180-period. The bill expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) ongoing waivers do not fulfill the purposes of the IRFA; and (2) the President, the State Department, and other executive branch officials should find ways to address existing violations through presidential actions. (Sec. 305) The bill directs the President to publish in the Federal Register: (1) any designation of a non-state actor as an entity of particular concern for religious freedom, and (2) the identities of individuals responsible for severe violations of religious freedom by non-state actors. TITLE IV--PROMOTION OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM (Sec. 401) The bill expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the President should request sufficient appropriations to promote international religious freedom, and (2) preference for such assistance should be given to projects targeting religious freedom violations in watch list countries countries and in countries designated as countries of particular concern for religious freedom.  TITLE V--DESIGNATED PERSONS LIST FOR PARTICULARLY SEVERE VIOLATIONS OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM  (Sec. 501) The State Department shall establish the Designated Persons List for Particularly Severe Violations of Religious Freedom of foreign individuals who are sanctioned (through visa denials, financial sanctions, or other measures) for ordering or otherwise directing particularly severe violations of freedom religion. The State Department shall submit the initial list within 180 days and provide updates every 180 days.  TITLE VI--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS (Sec. 601) The bill express the sense of Congress that U.S. institutions of higher education operating campuses outside the United States or establishing educational entities with foreign governments, particularly with or in countries that engage in or tolerate severe violations of religious freedom, should adopt a voluntary code of operating conduct that should:   uphold the right of freedom of religion of their employees and students;  ensure that the religious views and peaceful practice of religion in no way affect the status of a worker's or faculty member's employment or a student's enrollment; and  make every effort in all negotiations, contracts, or memoranda of understanding engaged in with a foreign government to protect academic freedom and the rights enshrined in the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights.  The bill expresses the sense of Congress that the President's annual national security strategy report should (1) promote international religious freedom as a foreign policy and national security priority; (2) be a guide for the strategies and activities of relevant federal agencies, and (3) inform the Department of Defense quadrennial defense review and the Department of State Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review.", "summary_short": "Frank R.

The summary of that version is repeated here.) Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act of 2016 (Sec. 4) This bill establishes the Public Buildings Reform Board to identify opportunities for the federal government to reduce significantly its inventory of civilian real property and reduce its costs.  (Sec. 10) The Board shall terminate six years after enactment of this Act. (Sec. 11) Each federal agency shall submit to the General Services Administration (GSA) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB): (1) current data on all federal civilian real properties owned, leased, or controlled by each agency; (2) recommendations on such properties that can be disposed of or outleased or that otherwise no longer meet agency needs or that can be transferred, exchanged, consolidated, co-located, reconfigured, or redeveloped; and (3) recommendations on operational efficiencies that the government can realize in its operation and maintenance of such properties. The OMB shall review agency recommendations, develop standards for reviewing such recommendations, and submit such standards and its recommendations to the Board. The OMB shall incorporate specified factors in developing such standards, including the extent and timing of potential costs and savings beginning with the date of completion of the proposed recommendation, the economic impact on existing communities in the vicinity of the civilian real property, and the extent to which:  the civilian real property could be used to produce the highest and best value and return for the taxpayer;  the operating and maintenance costs are reduced through consolidating, co-locating, and reconfiguring space and through realizing other operational efficiencies;  the utilization rate is being maximized and is consistent with nongovernmental industry standards;  reliance on leasing for long-term space needs is reduced;  a civilian real property aligns with the current mission of the agency;  there are opportunities to consolidate similar operations across or within agencies;  energy consumption is reduced; and  public access to agency services is maintained or enhanced.  Standards developed by OMB shall incorporate and apply clear standard utilization rates to the extent that such rates increase efficiency and provide performance data. The utilization rates shall be consistent throughout each applicable category of space and with nongovernment space utilization rates. To the extent the space utilization rate of a given agency exceeds the utilization rates to be applied under this bill, the OMB may recommend realignment, co-location, consolidation, or other action to improve space utilization. (Sec. 12) The Board shall: (1) identify at least five federal civilian properties not on the list of surplus or excess properties that have a total fair market value of not less than $500 million and not more than $750 million, (2) transmit a list of such properties to the OMB and Congress as Board recommendations, (3) analyze the inventory of federal civilian real property and the associated agency recommendations, (4) implement an accounting system to evaluate the cost of and returns on recommendations (under which the Board shall set a standard performance period of not less than 15 years), and (5) report its conclusions and recommendations to the OMB. The Board's first report shall include transactions valued, in total, at not more than $2.5 billion and its second report shall include transactions valued, in total, at not more than $4.75 billion. (Sec. 13) The OMB shall: (1) review Board recommendations and transmit to the Board and Congress a report on its approval or disapproval of such recommendations, and (2) report information about the properties involved to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  (Sec. 14) Each agency shall: (1) submit a report of excess to the GSA regarding the federal civilian properties for which recommendations have been approved (which properties shall be sold by the GSA within one year for fair market value at highest and best use), (2) immediately begin preparation to carry out the Board's recommendations after the OMB transmits such recommendations to Congress, (3) initiate all activities necessary for implementation of such recommendations not later than two years after such transmittal, and (4) complete implementation within six years after transmittal unless extenuating circumstances prevent timely completion.  HUD shall identify any suitable properties for use as a property benefitting the mission of assistance to the homeless for the purposes of further screening pursuant to the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. The OMB may exclude from the Board's recommendations properties that are not suitable to benefit the homeless but that the OMB determines are suitable for use as a state or local public park or recreation area. The bill permits the transfer of federal civilian property only if: (1) the disposing agency certifies that the costs of all environmental restoration, waste management, and environmental compliance activities otherwise to be paid by the agency with respect to the property equal or exceed the fair market value of the property; or (2) such costs are lower than the fair market value of the property and the recipient agrees to pay the difference. The agency may pay a recipient the amount by which such environmental costs exceed the property's fair market value. (Sec. 15) The bill authorizes specified sums to be appropriated for salaries and expenses of the Board and sums to be deposited into the Asset Proceeds and Space Management Fund for activities related to the implementation of the Board's recommendations.  (Sec. 16) There is established in the Treasury the Public Buildings Reform Board Salaries and Expenses Account and the Public Buildings Reform Board--Asset Proceeds and Space Management Fund. (Sec. 17) The GSA shall include, among other requirements for transmission to Congress of a prospectus of a proposed facility, a statement of how the proposed project is consistent with the standards and criteria developed under this bill. (Sec. 18) Actions taken pursuant to provisions of this bill regarding Board duties and OMB review, and actions of the Board, are not subject to judicial review. (Sec. 19) The Government Accountability Office shall annually review and report to Congress on agency implementation activities under this bill. (Sec. 20) After termination of the Board, the net proceeds from the transfer of excess real property to another federal agency or from the sale, lease, or other disposition of surplus real property shall be deposited into the real property account of the agency that had custody of the real property at the time it was determined to be excess. Such proceeds may be expended only as authorized in annual appropriations Acts. Any net proceeds that are not expended shall be used for deficit reduction. Any net proceeds not obligated within three years after the date of deposit and not expended within five years after such date shall be deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.  (Sec. 21) The GSA shall: (1) publish a database of all federal real property under the custody and control of all executive agencies, other than federal real property excluded for reasons of national security, and (2) make such database available to other federal agencies and accessible by the public at no cost through GSA's website.  (Sec. 22) The bill amends the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act to allow the use of surplus property to provide permanent housing with or without supportive services to assist the homeless. (Sec. 23) The GSA, in determining whether a museum is attended by the public and therefore eligible, as a nonprofit, tax-exempt educational or public health institution or organization, to receive donated federal surplus property, shall consider the museum to be public if it, at a minimum, accedes to any request submitted for access during business hours. (Sec. 24) The bill directs the GSA, by December 31, 2018, to sell, at fair market value at highest and best use: (1) a specified property bounded by 12th Street, Independence Avenue, C Street, and the James Forrestal Building in Southwest Washington, D.C.; and (2) the building known as the Cotton Annex in Southwest Washington, D.C.

The bill sets forth functions of the director, including to: establish and execute organizational plans and priorities; direct and manage training facilities, programs, and activities; develop training goals and curricula; disseminate homeland security information to law enforcement and security agencies and private sector stakeholders; conduct acquisition in compliance with federal law and regulations; coordinate and share digital resources with federal agencies; and collaborate to improve international instructional development, training, and technical assistance to foreign law enforcement. Additionally, the bill sets forth training responsibilities of the FLETC and partner organizations (i.e., federal agencies that participate in FLETC training programs under a formal memorandum of understanding). It authorizes the FLETC to: (1) train federal employees engaged in homeland security operations or law enforcement activities, and (2) execute strategic partnerships with state and local law enforcement agencies and coordinate with private sector stakeholders to provide training. The FLETC must consult with relevant law enforcement and security agencies to develop and deliver training programs.

Trivial or merely speculative injury or harm must be considered unlikely to cause substantial injury. But the FTC may consider substantial: (1) an injury that does small harm to a large number of people, or (2) a significant risk of concrete harm.  In determining the likelihood of substantial injury to consumers, the FTC must consider: (1) monetary harm, (2) unwarranted health or safety risks, or (3) only emotional or other more subjective harm.  The FTC must find an act or practice to be injurious in its net effects before it may be considered unfair. In determining the net effects, the FTC must consider: (1) remedy costs; and (2) burdens on society in general, such as increased paperwork or regulatory burdens or reduced incentives for innovation and capital formation. The FTC may not second-guess consumer decisions, but may consider whether an act or practice unreasonably creates or takes advantage of an obstacle to the free exercise of consumer decisionmaking. (Sec. 3) A consent order entered into by the FTC to enforce against alleged unfair or deceptive acts or practices must include a termination clause providing for the order to expire within eight years after it is entered into, unless it relates to alleged fraud or requires a longer time limit. A consent order longer than five years that is unrelated to alleged fraud must provide for the FTC to: (1) review the order five years after it is entered into, and (2) terminate the order if it has achieved its initial purposes. In determining the time limit, the FTC must consider: (1) the impact of technological progress on the order's continuing relevance; and (2) whether the person, partnership, or corporation would continue to engage in violations without the consent order.  The bill also allows persons, partnerships, or corporations subject to a consent order that is unrelated to alleged fraud and has been effective for at least five years to petition the FTC to terminate the order. (Sec. 4) The FTC must report annually on investigations the FTC has commenced, concluded with official agency action, or closed with no official agency action. With the consent of persons, partnerships, or corporations that were a subject of a closed investigation, the FTC must describe the legal analysis supporting its decisions not to continue with investigations and the industry sectors of those that were the subject of such closed investigations. The bill prohibits the FTC from including the identity of a person, partnership, or corporation that is a subject of an investigation in its description of an investigation that closed with no official agency action. (Sec. 5) The FTC is prohibited from recommending a legislative or regulatory action unless it publishes any economic analysis or advice prepared by the FTC's Bureau of Economics or indicates that no such analysis or advice was given. These requirements do not apply to recommendations made: (1) in an appearance by a commissioner before Congress, (2) to state or local governments, (3) in response to a request by a Member or committee of Congress, (4) to another federal agency in response to a notice of proposed rulemaking, or (5) to the United Kingdom or the European Union. (Sec. 6) The bill prohibits the FTC's guidelines or general statements of policy from: (1) conferring rights upon any person, state, or locality; or (2) binding the FTC or any person, state, or locality to a recommended approach. In enforcement actions, the FTC must prove a violation of FTC-enforced law.  The FTC's enforcement actions or consent orders may not be based solely on allegations that acts or practices are inconsistent with guidelines or general policy statements unless the acts or practices violate FTC-enforced law.  Compliance with guidelines or general statements of policy may be used as evidence of compliance with a law under which the guidelines or statements were issued.  (Sec. 7) Certain FTC investigations involving civil investigative demands must terminate six months after the FTC sends a verifiable written communication to notify the subject of the investigation. But an investigation may continue beyond that six-month period if the FTC: (1) sends an additional verifiable written communication, or votes to extend the investigation, before the period expires; or (2) votes within 30 days after the expiration of such period that it did not send a written communication because of excusable neglect or a circumstance beyond the FTC's control that rendered notification during such period impossible. A bipartisan majority of FTC commissioners may hold a nonpublic meeting to discuss official business if: (1) no votes or actions are taken, (2) each person at the meeting is an FTC commissioner or employee, and (3) an attorney from the FTC's Office of General Counsel is present. \"Bipartisan majority\" means a group of at least two commissioners that includes, for each political party of which any commissioner is a member, at least one commissioner who is a member of such political party and, if any commissioner has no political party affiliation, at least one unaffiliated commissioner. Within two business days after such a nonpublic meeting, the FTC must disclose on its website: (1) a list of persons who attended such meeting; and (2) a summary of discussed matters, except for matters that are classified or otherwise exempt from disclosure. (Sec. 9) The FTC must publish and submit to Congress annually: (1) the FTC's plan describing its projected activities and timelines for the next calendar year, and (2) a report on FTC enforcement actions to address unfair or deceptive acts or practices that may have targeted or significantly affected individuals who are 65 or older during the previous year.

(Sec. 3042) The FDA may, at the request of the drug's sponsor, approve an antibiotic or antifungal drug for use in a limited population if the drug is intended to treat a serious infection in a limited population of patients with unmet medical needs. The FDA's determination of the safety and effectiveness of such a drug must reflect the drug's use in the intended limited population. The label and prescribing information of such a drug must indicate that the drug has been approved for use only in a limited population. The sponsor of such a drug must submit promotional materials for the drug to the FDA prior to dissemination. The FDA may remove these requirements for such a drug that is approved for broader use. (Sec. 3044) The FDA must identify and publish susceptibility test interpretive criteria for antimicrobial drugs. (These criteria characterize the drug resistance of microbes.) Under specified conditions, the FDA may waive certain requirements for medical devices that characterize the drug resistance of microbes using these criteria. Subtitle F--Medical Device Innovations (Sec. 3051) The bill revises requirements regarding priority review of breakthrough medical devices. Upon a sponsor's request, the FDA must determine whether a device meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough device.

(Sec. 15006) The bill amends the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 to revise the applicability of\u00a0certain Medicare payment rules exempting LTCHs from negative payment adjustments for admissions from certain co-located hospitals beyond specified thresholds. These rules shall apply for an additional period beginning on October 1, 2016. (Sec. 15007) In addition, the bill amends the Pathway for SGR Reform Act of 2013 to expand to all LTCHs the application of a payment rule that requires the exclusion of certain patients for purposes of calculating length of stay. Under current law, the payment rule\u00a0applies\u00a0only to a hospital that was classified as an LTCH as of a specified date. (Sec. 15008) The bill removes certain hospitals specializing in neoplastic disease from their classification as LTCHs for purposes of Medicare payment.  (Sec. 15009) With specified exceptions, current law applies certain payment limits\u00a0to inpatient services for LTCHs that do not meet\u00a0specified discharge requirements. The bill: (1)\u00a0establishes a new temporary exception to these limits for certain spinal cord specialty hospitals, and (2) expands an existing temporary exception with respect to certain discharges involving severe wounds. TITLE XVI--PROVISIONS RELATING TO MEDICARE PART B  (Sec. 16001) The bill excludes certain off-campus outpatient departments\u00a0(OPDs) from\u00a0specified rules\u00a0that mandate\u00a0lower Medicare payments. Specifically, the exclusion applies to: (1)\u00a0cancer hospitals in off-campus OPDs, and (2) mid-build OPDs.\u00a0A \"mid-build\" OPD is one for which the provider had, before a certain date, a binding written agreement with an outside party for construction. (Sec. 16003) With respect to payment reductions for failing to meet requirements for the meaningful use of electronic health records, the bill exempts eligible professionals who are based in ambulatory surgical centers.  (Sec. 16004) The bill requires the\u00a0CMS\u00a0to continue to instruct Medicare contractors not to enforce requirements for direct physician supervision of outpatient therapeutic services in critical access and small rural hospitals through 2016. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission must report on the effect of extending this instruction on: (1)\u00a0Medicare beneficiaries, and (2) hospital staffing needs. (Sec. 16005) The bill amends the Patient Access and Medicare Protection Act to delay by six months the implementation of\u00a0specified Medicare fee schedule adjustments\u00a0with respect to\u00a0certain accessories and seating systems used with complex rehabilitation technology wheelchairs.  (Sec. 16006) The bill allows physical therapists to utilize \"locum tenens\" arrangements (through which a substitute practitioner is retained when the regular practitioner is absent\u00a0for a reason such as illness or pregnancy)\u00a0under Medicare in the same manner as physicians are allowed to use utilize such arrangements under current law.  (Sec. 16007)\u00a0The CMS shall: (1)\u00a0delay by\u00a0six months the full implementation of new Medicare payment rates for durable medical equipment (DME), and (2) study and report on the impact of applicable payment adjustments on the availability of DME to Medicare beneficiaries.  (Sec. 16008) Under current law, the CMS must use payment information from competitive acquisition programs to make payment adjustments for DME items furnished in areas outside of such programs. Current law also allows, but does not require,\u00a0the CMS to make such adjustments with respect to certain orthotics (such as splints and braces) and parenteral and enteral nutrients, equipment, and supplies (such as feeding tubes).\u00a0The bill requires the CMS, in making\u00a0these adjustments, to account for\u00a0stakeholder input. In addition, the CMS must account for a comparison of competitive acquisition areas and other areas with respect to the following factors:  average travel distance and cost associated with furnishing items and services,  average volume of items and services furnished by suppliers, and  number of suppliers.  TITLE XVII--OTHER MEDICARE PROVISIONS  (Sec. 17001) Until plan year 2019, the CMS may not terminate a Medicare Advantage (MA) plan solely because the plan failed to achieve a specified minimum quality rating. (Sec. 17002) The CMS\u00a0must annually report on specified Medicare enrollment data. (Sec. 17003) The CMS\u00a0shall: (1) request information and recommendations from stakeholders on information included in the\u00a0Welcome to Medicare package, and (2)\u00a0update the information included in the\u00a0package accordingly.  (Sec. 17004) Current law allows\u00a0the CMS to impose a temporary moratorium on the enrollment of new providers under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) if necessary to combat fraud, waste, or abuse. With specified exceptions, the bill prohibits payment under these programs to new providers in areas subject to such temporary moratorium.  (Sec. 17005) The bill expands and modifies enrollment and disenrollment options for MA-eligible individuals. Specifically, the bill extends the annual period in which an individual enrolled in MA may elect to instead receive benefits under the original Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) program as well as elect to change qualified prescription drug coverage. Furthermore, any MA-eligible individual (whether or not enrolled in MA) may once per period change a previous election with respect to receiving benefits through MA or Medicare FFS, including changing from one MA plan to another. Unsolicited marketing during this period is prohibited.  (Sec. 17006) The bill allows individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) to be eligible for MA. Under current law, only individuals who develop ESRD while already enrolled in an MA plan may be considered eligible. With respect to payment, the bill: (1) shifts responsibility for the cost of kidney acquisitions from MA plans to Medicare's\u00a0FFS program, and (2)\u00a0excludes\u00a0such costs\u00a0from the calculation of certain benchmarks that\u00a0form the basis for payment under MA plans. The CMS must conduct, and post online the results of, an evaluation of whether to include in a plan's quality rating a measure specifically related to care for MA enrollees with ESRD. The bill also modifies risk adjustment with respect to MA plans. Specifically, in making such adjustments, the CMS must:  take into account\u00a0an MA enrollee's total number of diseases or conditions,  use at least two years of diagnostic data,  provide separate adjustments for\u00a0individuals dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, and  evaluate whether other specified factors should be included in the risk adjustment model.  (Sec. 17007) The bill establishes additional requirements for assigning Medicare\u00a0FFS beneficiaries to accountable care organizations (ACOs) under the Medicare shared savings program. (The program enables ACOs to receive payments for savings stemming from care coordination and management.) Specifically, the bill requires the basis for assignment to reflect beneficiaries' utilization of not only primary care services provided by ACO physicians, but also those furnished in federally qualified health centers or rural health clinics. TITLE XVIII--OTHER PROVISIONS  (Sec. 18001) This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), and other laws to exempt qualified small employer health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs) from certain requirements that apply to group health plans.  A qualified small employer HRA is offered by employers that have fewer than 50 full-time employees and do not offer group health plans to any of their employees. A qualified small employer HRA must:   be provided on the same terms to all eligible employees of the employer;  be funded solely by the employer without salary reduction contributions;  provide, after an employee provides proof of coverage, for the payment or reimbursement of medical expenses of the employee and family members; and  limit annual payments and reimbursements to specified dollar amounts.   HRAs that meet these requirements are not considered group health plans and are exempt from various requirements that apply to group health plans, including coverage and cost-sharing requirements. (Under current law, employers that sponsor group health plans that do not meet specified requirements are subject to an excise tax.)  Coverage and payments under a qualified HRA are excluded from gross income, unless the employee does not have minimum essential coverage for the month in which the medical care was provided. Employers offering a qualified HRA must notify employees in advance regarding permitted benefits and report benefit information on W-2 forms and to health exchanges.  The bill sets forth requirements for determining whether an employee covered under an HRA is also eligible for premium subsidies under PPACA.

TITLE II--SUSTAINING NATIONAL SPACE COMMITMENTS (Sec. 201) The bill expresses the sense of Congress that NASA should be a multi-mission space agency and should have a balanced and robust set of core missions in space science, space technology, aeronautics, human space flight and exploration, and education.  TITLE III--MAXIMIZING UTILIZATION OF THE ISS AND LOW-EARTH ORBIT (Sec. 301) The bill states that the primary objectives of the International Space Station (ISS) program shall be to:  achieve the long-term goal and objectives for human space flight and exploration as specified in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010, and  pursue a research program that advances knowledge and provides other benefits to the nation.    The bill restates that it shall be U.S. policy, in consultation with its international partners in the ISS program, to support full and complete utilization of the ISS through at least 2024.  In furthering such policy, NASA shall:  pursue international, commercial, and intragovernmental means to maximize ISS logistics supply, maintenance, and operational capabilities, reduce risks to ISS systems sustainability, and offset and minimize U.S. operations costs relating to the ISS; utilize the ISS for the development of capabilities and technologies needed for the future of human space exploration beyond low-Earth orbit; and  utilize the ISS for Science Mission Directorate missions in low-Earth orbit.   (Sec. 302) It is the sense of Congress that:   NASA should build upon the success of the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services and Commercial Resupply Services programs that have allowed private sector companies to partner with NASA to deliver cargo and scientific experiments to the ISS since 2012, and  the 21st Century Launch Complex Program should be continued so as to leverage state and private investments to achieve such program's goals.   Congress reaffirms:  its commitment to the use of a commercially developed, private sector launch and delivery system to the ISS for crew missions; and  the requirement that NASA shall make use of U.S. commercially provided ISS crew transfer and crew rescue services.   The federal government may not acquire human space flight transportation services from a foreign entity unless:  there is no U.S. government-operated human space flight capability available, there is no U.S. commercial provider available, and  it is a qualified foreign entity.   The bill declares that nothing in this section shall prevent NASA from negotiating or entering into human space flight transportation arrangements with foreign entities to ensure safety of flight and continued ISS operations.  NASA shall protect the safety of government astronauts by ensuring that each commercially provided transportation system under the Commercial Crew Program meets all applicable human rating requirements under specified federal law.  Consistent with the findings and recommendations of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, NASA shall ensure that safety and the minimization of the probability of loss of crew are the critical priorities of such program.  NASA shall strive through the competitive selection process to minimize the life cycle cost to NASA through the planned period of commercially provided crew transportation services. The Commercial Orbital Transportation Services Program is renamed the Commercial Resupply Services Program.  The bill declares that it is U.S. policy that, in order to foster the competitive development, operation, improvement, and commercial availability of space transportation services, and to minimize the life cycle cost to NASA, NASA shall procure services for federal government access to and return from the ISS by fair and open competition for well-defined, milestone-based, Federal Acquisition Regulation-based contracts.  NASA shall, in a manner that does not add costs or schedule delays to the Commercial Crew and Commercial Resupply Services programs, ensure that all providers of such programs furnish evidence-based support for their costs and schedules. NASA shall submit to Congress a report:  identifying the lessons learned to date from previous and existing Commercial Resupply Services contracts, indicating whether changes are needed as to the manner in which NASA procures and manages similar services prior to the issuance of future Commercial Resupply Services procurement opportunities, and  identifying any lessons learned from the Commercial Resupply Services contracts that should be applied to the procurement and management of commercially provided crew transfer services to and from the ISS or to other future procurements.  (Sec. 303) NASA shall develop a plan for transitioning the ISS from the current regime that relies heavily on NASA sponsorship to a regime where NASA could be one of many customers of a low-Earth orbit non-governmental human space flight enterprise. NASA shall submit biennial reports until 2023 which include:   a description of the progress NASA is making in achieving its deep space human exploration objectives on the ISS and prospects for accomplishing future mission requirements, space exploration objectives, and other research objectives on future commercially supplied low-Earth orbit platforms or migration of those objectives to cis-lunar space; steps NASA is taking and will take, including demonstrations that could be conducted on the ISS, to stimulate and facilitate commercial demand and supply of products and services in low-Earth orbit;  identification of barriers preventing the commercialization of low-Earth orbit; the cost estimates for extending operations of the ISS to 2024, 2028, and 2030; evaluation of the feasible and preferred service life of the ISS beyond September 30, 2024, through at least 2028, as a unique scientific, commercial, and exploration-related facility; and the impact on deep space exploration capabilities, including a crewed mission to Mars in the 2030s, if the preferred service life of the ISS is extended beyond 2024 and NASA maintains a flat budget profile.   The bill defines \"cis-lunar space\" as the region of space from the Earth out to and including the region around the surface of the Moon.  If additional government crew, power, and transportation resources are available after meeting NASA's requirements for ISS activities as defined in the Human Exploration Roadmap to be developed pursuant to section 432 of this bill and related research, demonstrations identified in the biennial reports may:  test the capabilities needed to meet future mission requirements, space exploration objectives, and other research objectives described in such reports; and  demonstrate or test capabilities, including those for commercial modules or deep space habitats, Environmental Control and Life Support Systems, orbital satellite assembly, and exploration space suits.  (Sec. 304) NASA shall develop a plan for meeting NASA's projected space communication and navigation needs for low-Earth orbit and deep space operations in the 20-year period following enactment of this bill.  Such plan shall include:  the lifecycle cost estimates and a 5-year funding profile, the performance capabilities required to meet NASA's projected space communication and navigation needs, an identification of the projected space communications and navigation network and infrastructure needs, an identification of the projected Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System needs in the 20-year period following this bill's enactment, and the measures NASA is taking to mitigate threats to electromagnetic spectrum use.    (Sec. 305) Any contract between NASA and a provider (a person that provides domestic launch or domestic reentry services to the federal government) may provide that the United States will indemnify that provider against successful claims (including reasonable expenses of litigation or settlement) by third parties for death, bodily injury, or loss of or damage to property resulting from launch services and reentry services carried out under the contract that are defined in it as unusually hazardous or nuclear in nature, but only to the extent the total amount of successful claims related to the activities under that contract:  is more than the amount of insurance or demonstration of financial responsibility, and  is not more than $1.5 billion (plus additional amounts necessary to reflect inflation occurring after January 1, 1989) above such insurance or financial responsibility amount.   A contract made under this section that provides indemnification shall provide for:  notice to the United States of any claim or suit against the provider for death, bodily injury, or loss of or damage to property; and  control of or assistance in the defense by the United States, at its election, of such claim or suit and approval of any settlement.   A provider that has a contract with NASA under this section shall obtain liability insurance or demonstrate financial responsibility in amounts to compensate for the maximum probable loss from claims by:  a third party for death, bodily injury, or property damage or loss resulting from a launch service or reentry service carried out under the contract; and  the federal government for damage or loss to government property resulting from a launch service or reentry service carried out under such contract.   NASA shall determine maximum probable losses within 90 days of the provider requesting such a determination and submitting all of the information that NASA requires. NASA may revise such a determination based on new information. For the total claims related to one launch or reentry, a provider shall not be required to obtain insurance or demonstrate financial responsibility of more than:  $500 million with respect to a third party, or $100 million with respect to the federal government; or  the maximum liability insurance available on the world market at reasonable cost.   An insurance policy or demonstration of financial responsibility regarding this section shall protect to the extent of their potential liability for involvement in launch services or reentry services the federal government, its personnel and related entities, related entities of the provider, and government astronauts. NASA may not indemnify a provider under this section until there is a cross-waiver between NASA and the provider. The bill states that NASA shall reciprocally waive claims with a provider under which each party agrees to be responsible and agrees to ensure that its related entities are responsible for damage or loss to its property, or for losses resulting from any injury or death sustained by its employees or agents. Such a waiver shall apply only to the extent that the claims are more than the amount of insurance or demonstration of financial responsibility. Indemnification under this section may exclude claims that result from the willfull misconduct of the provider or its related entities.  No payment may be made under this section unless NASA or its designee certifies that the amount is just and reasonable. NASA may not provide indemnification under this section for an activity requiring a license or permit under provisions relating to commercial space launch activities.  TITLE IV--ADVANCING HUMAN DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION Subtitle A--Human Space Flight and Exploration Goals and Objectives (Sec. 411) The bill states that the long-terms goals for the human space flight and exploration efforts of NASA shall be:  to expand permanent human presence beyond low-Earth orbit, and to do so where practical, with the involvement of international, academic, and industry partners ,  crewed missions and progress toward achieving the expansion of human presence beyond low-Earth orbit to enable the potential for subsequent human exploration and the extension of human presence throughout the solar system, and  to enable a capability to extend human presence, including potential human habitation on another celestial body and a thriving space economy in the 21st Century.  (Sec. 412) The key U.S. objectives for human expansion into space shall include achieving human exploration of Mars and beyond through the prioritization of those technologies and capabilities best suited for such a mission in accordance with the stepping stone approach to exploration specified in federal law.

The bill funds most projects and activities at the rate established for FY2017 spending by the Budget Control Act of 2011.

(Sec. 102) The amounts authorized, and the authorized personnel ceilings, are those in the classified Schedule of Authorizations, which shall be made available to the congressional appropriations committees and the President. (Sec. 103) The ODNI, if it provides prior notice to Congress, may authorize employment of civilian personnel in excess of the number authorized for FY2017 if necessary for: (1) the performance of important intelligence functions, or (2) the conversion of a function of an element of the intelligence community to civilian personnel. The ODNI must establish guidelines to govern the treatment under such authorized personnel levels of employment or assignment in: (1) a student or trainee program; (2) a reserve corps or as a reemployed annuitant; or (3) details, joint duty, or long-term, full-time training.

(Sec. 305) Each element of the intelligence community may establish higher minimum rates of pay for positions that require STEM expertise.  (Sec. 306) The ODNI must implement a multisector workforce initiative to improve management of the intelligence community workforce and establish processes that enable the intelligence community to build and maintain an appropriate ratio of employees and core contractors. For each of FY2017 and FY2018, personnel of the intelligence community must be managed solely on the basis of: (1) the workload required to carry out intelligence community functions, and (2) the funds made available for each such fiscal year. The ODNI must ensure that there are employees in the number and with the combination of skills and qualifications necessary to carry out the functions for which funds are provided to the intelligence community.

The policy must: (1) prevent any conflict of interest in matters that inspectors general employees personally and substantially participated in during previous employment, and (2) ensure that personnel are free in fact and in appearance from personal, external, and organizational impairments to independence. The ODNI may not require employees of an inspector general office for an element of the intelligence community to rotate to a position in an office or organization in their element over which the office of inspector general exercises jurisdiction. Inspector general employees are exempt from a rotation that may impact their office's independence. (Sec. 310) Within 15 days after the President issues a policy or the Director of National Intelligence issues policy implementation guidance that assigns tasks, roles, or responsibilities to the intelligence community, the ODNI must notify and provide summaries to Congress.

The NRO may waive the requirement to develop such a plan if the Air Force is already carrying out an approved formal acquisition program that addresses DOD requirements for such activities. TITLE V--MATTERS RELATING TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES (Sec. 501) This title establishes an executive branch interagency committee to counter active measures by the Russian Federation to exert covert influence over peoples and governments (with the role of the Russian Federation hidden or not acknowledged publicly) through front groups, covert broadcasting, media manipulation, disinformation or forgeries, funding agents of influence, incitement, offensive counterintelligence, assassinations, or terrorist acts.

The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.) Postal Service Reform Act of 2016 TITLE I--POSTAL SERVICE BENEFITS REFORM (Sec. 101) This bill requires the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to establish a Postal Service Health Benefits Program within the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program to offer health benefits plans for U.S. Postal Service (USPS) employees, annuitant retirees, and their families at rates that reflect the cost of benefits provided solely to the USPS risk pool. To obtain or continue federal coverage, Medicare-eligible postal retirees must be enrolled in part A (Hospital Insurance) and part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance Benefits for Aged and Disabled) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act. Each plan must provide Medicare part D (Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit Program) prescription drug benefits. The USPS must establish a Medicare Education Program to notify USPS retirees and employees about the health plans and answer inquiries about Medicare enrollment.  (Sec. 102) The USPS's annual prefunding payments to the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund (PSRHBF) must be recomputed each year based on economic and actuarial methods to liquidate 100% of the USPS's actuarial liability by September 30, 2055. The bill cancels the unpaid final 6 of 10 prefunding payments that the USPS was obligated to pay into the fund from August 1, 2012, to September 30, 2016. The government's health benefit contributions to be paid up to the amount in the PSRHBF for USPS retirees since July 1, 1971, shall be the difference between a carrier's costs of providing health services to an individual and the amount withheld from the individual's annuity or paid by the individual. The USPS shall pay any remaining amount.  (Sec. 103) The OPM must use postal-specific demographic and economic assumptions in its valuations of the USPS's Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) pension accounts. Under CSRS and FERS, any projected USPS funding surpluses shall be returned to the USPS through amortized annual installments. (Currently, the OPM uses federal government-wide assumptions.)  (Sec. 104) Postal retirees not previously enrolled in Medicare will be transitioned automatically into Medicare part B, with their premiums reduced by 75% in the first year, 50% in the second year, and 25% in the third year, after which they will pay the full premium.TITLE II--POSTAL SERVICE OPERATIONS REFORM  (Sec. 201) This title reduces from nine to five the number of governors serving on the USPS Board of Governors with the Postmaster General and the Deputy Postmaster General. The USPS's power shall be vested in the governors and carried out by the Postmaster General consistent with the strategic direction and pricing and product strategy approved by the governors. The Postmaster General may delegate authority, but the bill removes the board's authority to delegate authority to the Postmaster General.  The USPS must transfer funds to the Department of State to coordinate and negotiate international postal rates and delivery services. (Sec. 202) The USPS must provide mail delivery other than door delivery (with a preference for centralized delivery) for new delivery points. It must also begin converting to centralized delivery, curbside delivery, or sidewalk delivery for existing: (1) business delivery points, and (2) residential delivery points with postal patrons' consent.  The USPS must provide for a voucher program to defray costs associated with conversion from door delivery that would otherwise be borne by postal patrons. The USPS must collect data on delivery mode costs and report on the potential savings of converting to more cost-efficient primary modes of mail delivery. The Inspector General of the Postal Community must report on the costs and benefits of the delivery point conversions under this bill.  (Sec. 203) In establishing or revising rates or classifications for first-class mail, standard mail, or other market-dominant products, the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) must consider: (1) the effect of rate increases upon the general public and business mail users, (2) the reliability of delivery timelines, (3) the need to ensure that the USPS has adequate revenues and has taken appropriate cost-cutting and efficiency measures to maintain financial stability, (4) the desirability of special classifications that do not cause unfair competitive advantage for the USPS or postal users or unreasonable disruption to the volume or revenues of other postal users, and (5) the importance of stability and predictability of rates to ratepayers. The title repeals a rate preference that currently allows certain political committees to send third-class mail at the nonprofit organization rate.  The PRC must promulgate regulations for streamlined after-the-fact review of newly proposed agreements between the USPS and users of the mail that provide rates not of general applicability for competitive products. Such a steamlined review shall apply only if agreements are functionally equivalent to existing agreements that have collectively covered attributable costs and improved the net financial position of the USPS.  (Sec. 204) The USPS may establish a program to provide property and services on behalf of state, local, or tribal governments for noncommercial products and services at USPS facilities, and a program to provide property and services to other executive agencies and the Government Publishing Office, but only if such property and services provide a reasonable contribution to the institutional costs of the USPS. The PRC must make annual determinations as to whether nonpostal activities carried out under the program comply with the requirement that each agency reimburse the USPS for at least 100% of the attributable costs of the provided property and services.  (Sec. 205) The USPS, when determining whether to close or consolidate a post office, must consider: (1) distance to the closest postal retail facility that is not operated by a contractor, (2) weather and terrain, and (3) the availability of broadband Internet service and commercial mobile service in the geographic area.  Before a determination as to the necessity for the closing or consolidation of a post office, the USPS must conduct a nonbinding survey to allow postal patrons to indicate their preferences among alternative postal service options. If closure or consolidation is necessary, the USPS must provide those patrons with access to postal services through the alternative option chosen by the highest number of survey respondents or through different means if the first option is not possible or is cost prohibitive. The Inspector General of the Postal Community must report to the USPS and Congress on the impacts of the post office restructuring plan (POSTPlan) on USPS expenses, revenue, and retail service provision. Prior to any hour changes or consolidation decisions related to POSTPlan initiative impacted post offices, the USPS must: (1) review the inspector general's report and recommendations, and (2) make any appropriate revisions to any planned efforts regarding the POSTPlan initiative. (Sec. 206) The USPS is prohibited from offering postage-evidencing products or services that do not comply with regulations applicable to private companies. (Sec. 207) The Postmaster General must reinstate 50% of the exigent rate surcharge for first-class mail and other market-dominant products implemented under the rate adjustment authority for extraordinary or exceptional circumstances that was in effect on April 9, 2016, thereby increasing the postage rate for first-class stamps by 1 cent. The USPS may not institute or maintain an additional rate increase predicated upon the same extraordinary or exceptional circumstances upon which rates have previously been increased under that authority.  (Sec. 208) The PRC must complete the initial review of the system for regulating rates and classes for market-dominant products such that a final rule for a revised or reapproved system is issued by January 1, 2018. (Sec. 209) The PRC must determine whether to revise methods of attributing costs to postal products. (Sec. 210) A parcel carried by an air carrier or foreign air carrier must use postage generated by a validated postage evidencing system and be entered with in-person sender verification.  (Sec. 211) The USPS must designate a single, unique zip code for: (1) Miami Lakes, Florida; (2) Storey County, Nevada; and (3) Flanders, Northampton, and Riverside in the Town of Southampton, New York.  TITLE III--POSTAL SERVICE PERSONNEL  (Sec. 301) The Postmaster General must appoint a Chief Innovation Officer to: (1) maximize USPS revenues, (2) utilize emerging information technologies, and (3) update an innovation strategy for postal and nonpostal products and services every three years.  (Sec. 302) The President must appoint an Inspector General of the Postal Community to consolidate the currently separate USPS and PRC inspectors general. (Currently, the governors on the Board of Governors appoint the USPS inspector general and the PRC appoints the PRC inspector general.)  (Sec. 303) The right to appeal adverse personnel actions to the Merit Systems Protection Board is extended to nonsupervisory professional, technical, clerical, or administrative USPS employees who are not represented by a bargaining representative.

The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.) Creating Financial Prosperity for Businesses and Investors Act TITLE I--SMALL BUSINESS CAPITAL FORMATION ENHANCEMENT (Sec. 101) This bill amends the Small Business Investment Incentive Act of 1980 to require the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue a public statement, and disclose any actions it intends to take, each time its annual government-business forum submits findings or recommendations regarding the current status of problems and programs relating to small business capital formation.  TITLE II--SEC SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATE (Sec. 201) This title amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to establish within the SEC an Office of the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation and a Small Business Capital Formation Advisory Committee. The Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation shall:  assist small businesses and small business investors in resolving significant problems they may have with the SEC or with self-regulatory organizations;  identify areas in which such businesses and investors would benefit from changes in SEC regulations or the rules of such organizations;  identify problems that small businesses have with securing access to capital, including any unique challenges to minority-owned and women-owned small businesses;  analyze the potential impact on such businesses and investors of proposed SEC regulations and proposed rules that are likely to have a significant economic impact on small businesses and small business capital formation;  conduct outreach to such businesses and investors to solicit views on relevant capital formation issues;  propose to the SEC changes in its regulations or orders, and propose to Congress legislative, administrative, or personnel changes, to mitigate problems identified and to promote the interests of such businesses and investors;  consult with the Investor Advocate on such proposals and advise the Investor Advocate on small business-related issues;  submit annual reports on its activities to specified congressional committees; and  be responsible for planning, organizing, and executing the annual government-business forum on small business capital formation.  The Small Business Capital Formation Advisory Committee shall provide the SEC with advice on SEC rules, regulations, and policies regarding its mission of protecting investors, maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitating capital formation, as they relate to:  capital raising by emerging, privately held small businesses and publicly traded companies with less than $250 million in public market capitalization through securities offerings;  trading in the securities of such businesses and companies; and  public reporting and corporate governance requirements of such businesses and companies.  The SEC shall assess the committee's recommendations and disclose any action it intends to take with respect to such recommendations.  TITLE III--SUPPORTING AMERICA'S INNOVATORS (Sec. 301) This title amends the Investment Company Act of 1940 to increase from 100 to 250 the limit on the number of people who may own securities in certain venture capital funds before the issuer is required to register as an investment company. Under current law, an issuer is exempt from requirements to register as an investment company if its outstanding securities (other than short-term paper) are beneficially owned by not more than 100 persons and it is not making a public offering. The bill revises this exemption to allow a special category of venture capital funds (with no more than $10 million in invested capital, adjusted annually for inflation) to remain exempt from these registration requirements until they have more than 250 persons who own their securities. TITLE IV--FIX CROWDFUNDING  (Sec. 401) This title amends the Securities Act of 1933 and the Investment Company Act of 1940 to allow crowdfunding issuers to sell shares through a special purpose entity known as a crowdfunding vehicle, and exempt them from registering as investment companies, if their crowdfunding vehicle is a company that:  has purposes limited to acquiring, holding, and disposing securities issued by a single company in one or more transactions and made pursuant to crowdfunding exemption transaction requirements;  issues only one class of securities;  receives no compensation for such acquisition, holding, or disposition of securities;  is a co-issuer with the company whose securities it holds; and  meets specified requirements related to disclosure obligations and the use of investment advisers.  (Crowdfunding is a method of capital formation in which groups of people pool money, typically composed of small individual contributions, and often via Internet platforms, either to invest in a company or to support an effort by others to accomplish a specific goal.) (Sec. 402) The bill amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to revise the conditions upon which the SEC shall exempt securities issued in crowdfunding transactions from SEC registration requirements. Under current law, holders of crowdfunded shares do not count toward the shareholder threshold beyond which an issuer is required to register its securities with the SEC, provided that the issuer: (1) is current in its annual reporting obligations, (2) retains the services of a registered transfer agent, and (3) has less than $25 million in assets. The bill maintains this exemption but removes and replaces the conditions upon which it applies. Specifically, holders of crowdfunded shares shall not count toward the shareholder threshold if the issuer has: (1) a public float of less than $75 million, and (2) annual revenues of less than $50 million. TITLE V--FAIR INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR PROFESSIONAL EXPERTS  (Sec. 501) This title amends the Securities Act of 1933 to qualify as accredited investors four categories of natural persons:   whose individual net worth, or joint net worth with his or her spouse, exceeds $1 million (adjusted every five years for inflation); whose individual income exceeded $200,000 in each of the two most recent years, or whose joint income with spouse exceeded $300,000 in each of those years, and has a reasonable expectation of reaching the same income level in the current year;  who are currently licensed or registered as a broker or investment adviser by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) (or an equivalent self-regulatory organization), or a state division responsible for licensing or registration of individuals in connection with securities activities; or  whose demonstrable education or job experience qualifies as professional knowledge of a subject related to a particular investment, and whose education or job experience is verified by the FINRA or an equivalent self-regulatory organization.   For purposes of the first category of net worth qualifications, a person's net worth shall exclude:   the person's primary residence; and  as a liability any indebtedness secured by the primary residence, up to the estimated fair market value of the residence at the time of the sale of securities.  Indebtedness secured by the person's primary residence in excess of the residence's estimated fair market value at the time of the sale of securities, however, shall be included in net worth as a liability. TITLE VI--U.S. TERRITORIES INVESTOR PROTECTION  (Sec. 601) This title amends the Investment Company Act of 1940 to repeal the exemption from its coverage of investment companies created under the laws of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or any other U.S. possession.", "summary_short": "(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced.

This FSOC determination procedure replaces the current process under which bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more are automatically subject to such enhanced supervision and prudential standards.

(Sec. 5) FSOC is prohibited from making a final determination concerning a bank holding company under this bill before one year after its enactment. A bank holding company shall be deemed to have been the subject of such a final determination during this one-year period, however, if its total consolidated assets are $50 billion or more.

But the aggregate amount collected from all bank holding companies so assessed is limited to a specified amount to be transferred to: (1) FSOC to distribute to the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the general fund of the Treasury for administrative costs resulting from this bill; and (2) the FDIC for resolution costs resulting from this bill.

The summary of that version is repeated here.) National Forest System Trails Stewardship Act  (Sec. 4) This bill directs the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to publish a national strategy to significantly increase the role of volunteers and partners in trail maintenance.   The strategy shall:    augment and support the capabilities of federal employees to carry out or contribute to trail maintenance;   provide opportunities for volunteers and partners to carry out trail maintenance in each region of the Forest Service;   address the barriers to increased volunteerism and partnerships;   prioritize increased volunteerism and partnerships in those regions with the most severe trail maintenance needs, and where backlogs are jeopardizing access to national forest lands; and   aim to increase trail maintenance by volunteers and partners by 100% within 5 years.    As a component of the strategy, USDA shall study opportunities to improve trail maintenance by addressing opportunities to use fire crews in trail maintenance activities that do not jeopardize firefighting capabilities, public safety, or resource protection. Upon a determination that trail maintenance would be advanced by the use of fire crews, USDA shall incorporate these proposals into the strategy.  The Volunteers in the National Forest Act of 1972 is amended, for purposes of certain provisions relating to the employment status of volunteers in the National Forests Program, to include as a volunteer a person providing volunteer services to USDA who is recruited, trained, and supported by a cooperator under a mutual benefit agreement with the USDA.  Such a volunteer also performs such volunteer services under the cooperator's supervision as directed by the USDA in such agreement, including direction that specifies:  the volunteer services to be performed by the volunteers and the supervision to be provided by the cooperator; the project safety standards and protocols to be adhered to by the volunteers and enforced by the cooperator; and  the on-site visits to be made by USDA, when feasible, to verify that volunteers are performing the volunteer services and the cooperator is providing the supervision agreed upon.   USDA shall adopt regulations for the implementation of this section. Such regulations shall ensure that the financial risk from claims or liability associated with volunteers who undertake trail maintenance is shared by all administrative units.  USDA shall report on:   the effectiveness of the strategy in addressing the trail maintenance backlog; the increase in volunteerism and partnership efforts on trail maintenance as a result of the strategy; the miles of National Forest System trails maintained by volunteers and partners, and the approximate value of volunteer and partnership efforts; the status of the stewardship credits for the outfitters and guides pilot program established by this bill; and recommendations for further increasing volunteerism and partnerships in trail maintenance.   (Sec. 5) USDA shall select at least 9 and no more than 15 priority areas for increased trail maintenance accomplishments. Priority areas shall include a well-defined region on National Forest System land where the lack of trail maintenance has:  reduced access to public land; led to an increase, or risk of increase, in harm to natural resources; jeopardized public safety; resulted in trails being impassible by the intended managed users; or  increased future deferred trail maintenance costs.   In selecting priority areas, USDA shall:  consider any public input received on such areas within three months of enactment of this bill; consider the range of trail users, including motorized and non-motorized trail users; and include at least one such area in each region of the Forest Service.   Within six months of the selection of the priority areas, USDA shall develop an approach to substantially increase trail maintenance accomplishments within each area.  In developing such an approach, USDA shall:  consider any public input received on trail maintenance priorities and needs within the priority area, consider the costs and benefits of increased trail maintenance within the priority area, and  incorporate partners and volunteers in the trail's maintenance.   In utilizing such an approach, USDA shall substantially increase trail maintenance within each of the priority areas. Regional volunteer and partnership coordinators may be responsible in assisting partner organizations in the development and implementation of volunteer and partnership projects to increase trail maintenance within the priority areas. USDA shall, in its sole discretion, periodically review the priority areas to determine whether revisions are necessary and may revise such areas, including by the selection of new areas or the removal of existing areas.  (Sec. 6) USDA may enter into cooperative agreements with any state, tribal, local governmental, and private entities to carry out this bill.  A cooperative agreement authorized under this section may:  improve trail maintenance in a priority area, implement the strategy, or  advance trail maintenance as deemed appropriate by the USDA.  (Sec. 7) USDA shall establish a pilot program on at least 20 administrative units to offset all or part of the land use fee for an outfitting and guiding permit by the cost of the work performed by the permit holder for the construction, improvement, or maintenance of National Forest System trails, trailheads, or developed sites that support public use.

(Sec. 202) To be eligible, a dam must be federally owned and included in the BIA's Safety of Dams program. The low hazard fund and high hazard fund must be used to pay for maintenance, repair, and replacement activities for dams classified under guidelines of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as low hazard and significant or high hazard, respectively. (Sec. 203) The BIA must: (1) develop programmatic goals and prioritization criteria before expending funds; (2) prioritize dams that serve more than one tribe or highly populated Indian communities; (3) consult with landowners served by the dam before expending funds, except in emergencies; and (4) ensure that, each year, every dam in need of critical maintenance receives funding. Subtitle B--Management (Sec. 211) The Department of the Interior must establish in the BIA the Tribal Safety of Dams Committee to study the modernization of the Indian Dams Safety Act of 1994 and develop recommendations for legislation to improve that Act.

DHS must deploy and operate, for use by other agencies, capabilities to detect and prevent or remove cybersecurity risks in network traffic transiting or traveling to or from agency information systems. DHS may access, and agencies may disclose to DHS, information transiting agency systems, regardless of the location from which the information is accessed, notwithstanding any laws that would otherwise restrict or prevent such disclosures. Agencies must utilize such capabilities and adopt subsequent improvements. DHS must establish a pilot to test and deploy advanced technologies to improve detection and prevention.  DHS must ensure that: (1) activities are reasonably necessary to protect agency information and systems from cybersecurity risks, (2) information accessed by DHS will be retained no longer than reasonably necessary, (3) notice has been provided to users of agency information systems concerning access to their communications, and (4) activities are implemented pursuant to policies governing the operation of the intrusion detection and prevention capabilities.  Liability protections are provided to private entities authorized to assist DHS with such capabilities. But such liability protections shall not be construed to authorize an Internet service provider to break a user agreement with a customer. The Department of Justice must ensure that guidelines for such capabilities are consistent with laws governing the acquisition, interception, retention, use, and disclosure of communications. The OMB and DHS must update government-wide policies and brief Congress regarding the prioritization and use of network security monitoring tools within agency networks. The Department of Defense and the intelligence community are exempt from this bill's procedures. (Sec. 4) DHS must include in the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation Program advanced network security tools to improve visibility of network activity to detect and mitigate intrusions and anomalous activity. The OMB must implement a plan to ensure that agencies utilize such advanced tools.  DHS must collaborate with the OMB to update government information security metrics to include measures of intrusion and incident detection and response times. The OMB must display additional agency metrics on federal government performance websites.  Upon an agency's request, DHS may operate and maintain technology that is deployed to agencies to diagnose and mitigate against cyber threats and vulnerabilities. (Sec. 5) DHS must require implementation of best practices for securing agency information systems against intrusion and preventing data exfiltration in the event of an intrusion. Agencies must: (1) identify their stored sensitive and mission critical data, (2) assess data access controls, (3) encrypt data consistent with federal information system standards, (4) implement a single sign-on trusted identity platform for individuals accessing each public website of the agency that requires user authentication, and (5) implement multifactor authentication for remote access to agency systems and for user accounts with elevated privileges. (Sec. 6) The Government Accountability Office must report on the effectiveness of the federal government's strategy to secure agency information systems. On an annual basis: (1) DHS must report on the implementation status of intrusion detection and prevention capabilities, and (2) the OMB must report on agency application of such capabilities. The OMB must submit updated intrusion assessment plans to Congress and report annually on intrusion assessment findings, advanced network security tools, and agency compliance. (Sec. 7) The authority for operating such federal intrusion detection and prevention capabilities terminates seven years after enactment of this bill.  (Sec. 8) The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) must submit to Congress an assessment of: (1) the risks that would result from the breach of unclassified information systems that provide access to information that, when combined with other unclassified information, may comprise classified information; and (2) the cost and impact on the mission carried out by each agency if such systems were subsequently classified. (Sec. 9) DHS and the ODNI must coordinate with agencies to conduct an ongoing damage and risk assessment relating to data breaches at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The ODNI must report on: (1) the extent to which federal data was compromised, exfiltrated, or manipulated by the same entity that caused the OPM data breach; (2) national security impacts; and (3) whether information accessed through the breach has been released or deployed. (Sec. 10) DHS may issue an emergency directive to an agency to take any lawful action regarding the operation of the agency's information system (including systems owned or operated by another entity on behalf of an agency) in response to a known or reasonably suspected information security threat, vulnerability, or incident that represents a substantial threat to information security. DHS must report annually to Congress regarding specific actions taken pursuant to such directives.  If DHS determines that there is an imminent threat for which a directive is unlikely to result in a timely response, DHS may authorize the use of protective capabilities under DHS control for communications or system traffic transiting to or from, or stored on, an agency information system without prior consultation with the affected agency. But DHS must immediately notify the OMB, each affected agency, and Congress of the use of such imminent threat authority and the reasons for, and duration of, the action.  DHS may direct or authorize such lawful action or protective capability only: (1) to protect agency information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction; or (2) to require the remediation of, or to protect against, identified information security risks for information collected or maintained by or on behalf of an agency or that portion of an information system used or operated by an agency or other organization on an agency's behalf.

The bill expands the group whose retiree health benefits are taken into account in determining the amount that the Department of the Treasury must transfer from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund and the General Fund of the Treasury to the Multiemployer Health Benefit Plan.  (Under current law, transfers are calculated by taking into account beneficiaries that actually enrolled in the plan as of December 31, 2006, and who are eligible to receive benefits under the plan on the first day of the calendar year for which the transfer is made.) The expanded group includes: (1) beneficiaries actually enrolled in the plan as of the date of enactment of this bill and who are eligible for benefits on the first day of the calendar year for which the transfer is made, and (2) beneficiaries whose health benefits would be denied or reduced as a result of a bankruptcy proceeding commenced in 2012 or 2015.  A voluntary employees' beneficiary association (VEBA) established as a result of a bankruptcy proceeding described above must transfer to the plan any amounts received as a result of the bankruptcy proceeding, reduced by the amount of the VEBA's administrative costs. Transfers by Treasury are reduced by the amount of the VEBA transfers.  Treasury must also transfer additional funds to the 1974 UMWA Pension Plan to pay pension benefits required under that plan if the amounts available for transfer under SMCRA's $490 million annual limit exceed the amounts required to be transferred for other purposes (including to the UMWA Health Plans).  The bill also: (1) prohibits the pension plan from making certain changes to benefits during any year in which a transfer is received, and (2) establishes additional reporting requirements for the plan. The bill repeals requirements for current and former signatories to labor agreements with the UMWA to pay unassigned beneficiaries premiums or backstop premiums if transfers under SMCRA are less than the amount required to be transferred.

(Sec. 5) Any order issued under this bill shall provide for establishment of a Concrete Masonry Products Board to carry out a program of generic promotion, research, and education regarding concrete masonry products. The order shall specify the powers and duties of the board. The board may not engage in any action, nor use any funds received under this bill, to:   influence legislation, elections, or governmental action;  engage in any conflict of interest; engage in advertising that is false or misleading; or  engage in any promotion, research, or education that would be disparaging to other construction materials, or any promotion or project that would benefit any individual manufacturer.  Manufacturers and importers shall maintain, and make available for inspection, specified records. (Sec. 6) Any order must also require that quarterly assessments be paid by manufacturers for any concrete masonry products manufactured at least 180 days before remittance of the assessment to the board. The bill establishes an initial assessment rate of $0.01 per concrete masonry unit sold. The board may increase or decrease such rate but any change may not exceed $0.01 per unit, and be made no more than once per year. The maximum rate shall be $0.05 per unit.  At least 50% of the assessments (less administrative expenses) paid by a manufacturer shall be used to support research, education, and promotion programs and projects in support of the manufacturer's geographic region. The bill divides the states into five specified regions, whose composition Commerce may adjust on the board's recommendation. (Sec. 7) During the 60-day period preceding the proposed effective date of an order, Commerce shall conduct a referendum for order approval, according to specified procedures, among the manufacturers required to pay assessments under it. (Sec. 8) The bill prescribes requirements for petition and review of an order, including order enforcement through U.S. district courts. Commerce may assess a civil penalty on any person willfully violating such an order or regulation. (Sec. 10) Commerce may also conduct appropriate investigations to administer this bill (with power of subpoena). (Sec. 11) Commerce must suspend or terminate any order, or a provision of an order, that obstructs or does not tend to effectuate the purposes of this bill, or that is not favored by a majority of all votes cast in a referendum. (Sec. 15) Funds appropriated to carry out this bill may not be used for the board's payment of expenses or expenditures in administering the order. (Sec. 16) In each fiscal year that begins on the enactment of this bill and ends on the last day of the 11th fiscal year that begins on or after such enactment, the board may not obligate an amount greater than the sum of:  73% of the amount of assessments estimated to be collected in such fiscal year; 73% of the amount of assessments actually collected in the most recent fiscal year for which an audit report has been submitted as of the beginning of the fiscal year for which the amount that may be obligated is being determined, less the estimate made for the most recent fiscal year; and unobligated amounts permitted in the preceding fiscal years.   This bill prescribes a special rule regarding this prohibition for the amount of assessments estimated to be collected in the 9th and 10th fiscal years that begin on or after such enactment.

TITLE I--PURPOSES AND POLICY (Sec. 102) The bill states that it is the policy of the United States to:  take immediate actions to stop the illegal global trade in wildlife and wildlife products and associated transnational organized crime;  employ appropriate assets and resources for curtailing poaching and disrupting and dismantling illegal wildlife trade networks and the financing of those networks in each foreign country that is a major source or major transit point of wildlife trafficking products or their derivatives, or a major consumer of wildlife trafficking products (focus country); provide assistance in helping focus countries in halting the poaching of imperiled species and ending the illegal trade in wildlife and wildlife products;  build upon the \"National Strategy for Combating Wildlife Trafficking\" published on February 11, 2014, or a successor strategy, to further combat wildlife trafficking; and  recognize the ties of wildlife trafficking to broader forms of transnational organized criminal activities, and where applicable, to focus on those crimes.  TITLE II--REPORT ON MAJOR WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING COUNTRIES (Sec. 201) The Department of State must submit an annual report for five years after this bill's enactment that: (1) lists each focus country as determined by the State Department; and (2) identifies each country of concern, which is a focus country with a government that has actively engaged in or knowingly profited from the trafficking of endangered or threatened species. TITLE III--FRAMEWORK FOR INTERAGENCY RESPONSE (Sec. 301) The bill establishes coordination and collaboration requirements for the Presidential Task Force on Wildlife Trafficking.  Each year the task force must submit a strategic assessment of its work and provide a briefing to appropriate congressional committees. The bill terminates the task force five years after enactment of this bill, unless the President terminates it on an earlier date.  TITLE IV--PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS THE ESCALATING WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING CRISIS  (Sec. 401) The State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) may provide assistance to focus countries for improving the effectiveness of wildlife law enforcement in regions and countries that have demonstrated capacity, willingness, and need for assistance. The bill urges the United States to continue providing defense articles (not including significant military equipment), defense services, and related training to appropriate security forces of African countries for countering wildlife trafficking and poaching.  (Sec. 402) The State Department and USAID may design and implement programs in focus countries for: (1) increasing the capacity of wildlife law enforcement and customs and border security officers in the countries, or (2) combating the transnational trade in illegal wildlife.  (Sec. 403) Each chief of mission to a focus country should begin to implement the recommendations on wildlife trafficking contained in the task force's strategic plan within two years of this bill's enactment. (A chief of mission is the principal officer in charge of a U.S. diplomatic mission or of a U.S. office abroad which is diplomatic in nature. The chief of mission is often, but not always, an ambassador.) (Sec. 404) The State Department may also provide support in focus countries to carry out the recommendations on wildlife trafficking contained in the task force's strategic plan related to the development, scaling, and replication of community wildlife conservancies and community conservation programs in those countries to: (1) assist with rural stability and security for people and wildlife, (2) empower and support communities in managing or benefiting from their wildlife resources in a long-term biologically viable manner, and (3) reduce the threat of poaching and trafficking.  TITLE V--OTHER ACTIONS RELATING TO WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING PROGRAMS  (Sec. 501) The State Department is included in the certification process under the Pelly Amendment to the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967. (The Pelly Amendment authorizes the President to embargo wildlife products when the Department of Commerce or the Department of the Interior certifies that nationals of a foreign country are engaging in trade or certain actions that diminish the effectiveness of an international agreement for the conservation of endangered or threatened species.) Commerce and Interior shall each report each certification to the President within 15 days after it is made.  (Sec. 502) The bill applies provisions of the federal criminal code concerning money laundering to wildlife trafficking violations of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the African Elephant Conservation Act, and the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act of 1994, if the endangered or threatened species of fish or wildlife, products, items, or substances involved in the violation and relevant conduct have a total value of more than $10,000.", "summary_short": "Eliminate, Neutralize, and Disrupt Wildlife Trafficking Act of 2016  This bill addresses wildlife trafficking, which is the poaching or other illegal taking of protected or managed species and the illegal trade in wildlife and their related parts and products.

Full Summary: Water Resources Development Act of 2016 TITLE I--GENERAL PROVISIONS (Sec. 101) This title expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) water resources development projects are critical to maintaining economic prosperity, national security, and environmental protection; (2) Congress has required timely delivery of project and study authorization proposals from nonfederal project sponsors and the Corps of Engineers; and (3) Congress should consider a Water Resources Development Act at least once every Congress. (Sec. 102) The Corps of Engineers must enter cooperative agreements with youth service and conservation corps organizations for services on Corps projects. (Sec. 103) The Corps of Engineers must use its existing channel depths and dimensions authority under the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1915 to carry out navigation safety activities at harbor or inland harbor projects eligible for Corps operation and maintenance under the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (WRDA 1986), including at entrances, bends, sidings, and turning places necessary for the free movement of boats. (Sec. 104) Under WRDA 1986, the Corps of Engineers must use at least 10% (currently, exactly 10%) of the difference between the funds made available for a fiscal year to pay operations and maintenance costs of harbors and inland harbors and the funds that were available for such costs for FY2012 as priority funding for emerging harbor projects that transit less than 1 million tons of cargo annually. Not more than 90% (currently, exactly 90%) of priority funds shall be used for high- and moderate-use harbor projects. These allocations are made permanent.  (Sec. 105) The Corps of Engineers must report on its inventory and assessment of the structural condition of federal breakwaters and jetties protecting harbors and inland harbors.  (Sec. 106) The bill reduces from $15 million to $5 million the total amount of harbor maintenance taxes for the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) that a port must collect annually to be considered a donor port that is eligible to receive amounts from the Corps of Engineers for payments to cargo shippers or importers, maintenance dredging and disposal of legacy-contaminated sediment, or environmental remediation.  (Sec. 107) The Water Resources Development Act of 2007 (WRDA 2007) is amended to require the Corps of Engineers to consider regional (currently, local) communities when it makes recommendations for harbor and navigation improvements that are not justified solely by national economic development benefits. (Sec. 108) The Corps of Engineers must establish a pilot program to carry out 10 cost-sharing projects for the beneficial use of dredged material. Project selections must be based solely on: (1) environmental, economic, and social benefits; and (2) diversity in project types and geographical locations. The projects are exempt from federal standards that require dredged material disposals representing the least costly alternatives. Regional teams that include local agencies and stakeholders must be established to identify and assist in implementation of projects. (Sec. 109) The Corps of Engineers must establish a pilot program to accept services from nonfederal interests or commercial entities for removal of sediment captured behind up to 10 U.S. dams under Corps jurisdiction for the purpose of restoring authorized storage capacity. The nonfederal interests or commercial entities may sell or otherwise dispose of the removed sediment without compensating the Corps for the sediment's value. (Sec. 110) For reservoirs that the Corps of Engineers is authorized to regulate for the use of storage allocated for flood risk management or navigation, the Corps may receive funds from nonfederal interests to formulate or revise operational documents. (Sec. 111) In a state in which a drought emergency has been declared or was in effect during the year before enactment of this bill, the Corps of Engineers may enter agreements with nonfederal interests to carry out approved water supply conservation measures. (Sec. 112) The bill removes provisions of the Water Supply Act of 1958 concerning Congress's recommendation for an interstate water compact for the operation of projects in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River System and the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa River System. (Sec. 113) For emergency repairs or restoration of flood control works or hurricane or shore protective structures, the Corps of Engineers must consult with nonfederal sponsors on the availability of nonstructural alternatives and obtain the sponsor's agreement before implementation. (Sec. 114) Nonfederal interests are released from any obligation to operate and maintain the nonstructural and nonmechanical components of a project for environmental protection and restoration or aquatic ecosystem restoration if the Corps of Engineers determines that the project's: (1) construction has been complete for 50 years, or (2) purpose has been achieved.

Highlights:  This bill provides FY2017 appropriations for Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies; continuing appropriations through December 9, 2016, for other federal agencies; and FY2016 supplemental appropriations to respond to the Zika virus.  The bill also includes several rescissions and provides additional funding for disaster relief. The bill includes four divisions:   Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017;   Zika Response and Preparedness;   Continuing Appropriations Act, 2017; and Rescissions of Funds.   Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017  This division provides FY2017 appropriations to the Department of Defense (DOD) for military construction, military family housing, the U.S. share of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Security Investment Program, and base closures and realignments.  The division also provides appropriations to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for veterans benefit and health care programs, Departmental Administration, and the National Cemetery Administration.  Related agencies and programs funded in the division include the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims; the Armed Forces Retirement Home; and the Cemeterial Expenses of the Army, including Arlington National Cemetery.  The division includes both mandatory and discretionary funding. It increases FY2017 discretionary funding for Military Construction and Veterans Affairs above FY2016 levels, including an increase for the VA and a decrease for Military Construction.  The division includes provisions that:    permit the VA to pay for fertility treatments, counseling, and adoption expenses for veterans with certain service-connected disabilities;   establish additional procedures and protections for VA whistle-blowers; and prohibit funds from being used for: (1) constructing, renovating, or expanding a facility for the purpose of housing individuals detained at U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; and (2) closing or transferring the facility.   Zika Response and Preparedness  This division provides FY2016 supplemental appropriations to the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and State to respond to the Zika virus. The division permits the funds to be used for the duration of FY2017, designates the funds as emergency requirements, and sets forth congressional reporting and notification requirements. Continuing Appropriations Act, 2017  This division provides continuing appropriations to federal agencies through December 9, 2016, or the enactment of specified appropriations legislation.  It is known as a continuing resolution (CR) and prevents a government shutdown that would otherwise occur when FY2017 begins on October 1, 2016, because eleven of the twelve FY2017 regular appropriations bills that fund the federal government have not been enacted (excluding the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017 included in this bill).  This division funds most projects and activities at the FY2016 levels, with the inclusion of an across-the-board reduction of less than 1% to most programs. The division also includes a number of exceptions which provide funding flexibility and additional appropriations to various programs, including additional funding for disaster recovery efforts.  The division also extends several programs that are scheduled to expire at the end of FY2016.  Rescissions Of Funds  This division rescinds unobligated balances of funds from several agencies and programs throughout the federal government.  Full Summary:  Continuing Appropriations and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017, and Zika Response and Preparedness Act  (Sec. 3) Specifies that references to \"this Act\" included in any division refer only to the provisions of the division unless the bill expressly provides otherwise.

(Sec. 5) Specifies that each amount in this bill designated by Congress as an emergency requirement is contingent on the President also designating all of the emergency amounts and transmitting the designations to Congress.

The summary of that version is repeated here.) West Los Angeles Leasing Act of 2016 (Sec. 2) This bill authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to carry out the following leases at the VA's West Los Angeles Campus in Los Angeles, California:   any enhanced-use lease of real property for supportive housing that principally benefits veterans and their families;  any lease of real property for not to exceed 50 years to a third party for services that principally benefit veterans and their families and that are related to health and wellness, education, vocational training and employment, peer activities or recreation, legal and federal benefits assistance, volunteerism, family support services, and transportation; and  a lease of real property for up to 10 years to the Regents of the University of California, on behalf of the University of California, Los Angeles, if the lease is consistent with the VA master plan, the provision of veterans services is the predominant focus, and the Regents agree to provide non-VA compensated additional services that principally benefit veterans and their families.  The VA shall not enter into land-sharing agreements unless the agreements provide additional health care resources and benefit veterans and their families in ways other than generating additional revenue.  Funds received by the VA from a lease shall be credited to the applicable VA medical facilities account and shall be available, without fiscal year limitation and without further appropriation, exclusively for campus renovation and maintenance.  The VA may, notwithstanding any other provision of law other than federal laws relating to environmental and historic preservation, grant easements or rights-of-way on, above, or under campus lands to: (1) any local or regional public transportation authority to construct, operate, or maintain public mass transit facilities; and (2) California, the County of Los Angeles, the City of Los Angeles, any agency or political subdivision thereof, or any public utility company for the purpose of providing public utilities.  The VA may not sell or convey to a third party fee simple title to any real property or related improvements made at the campus.  The VA shall ensure that each lease is consistent with the draft master plan approved by the VA on January 28, 2016, or successor master plans.  The VA shall establish, within 180 days, a Community Veterans Engagement Board to coordinate locally with the VA to: (1) identify community goals; and (2) provide advice to improve services for veterans, members of the Armed Forces, and their families.  The VA shall submit, annually, an evaluation of all campus leases and land-sharing agreements. The VA Inspector General shall report on: (1) all campus leases; and (2) the VA's management of land use at the campus, including an assessment of efforts to implement the master plan.  (Sec. 3) The VA may not waive or postpone the obligation of a lessee to pay any consideration under an enhanced-use lease, including monthly rent. (The enhanced-use lease program is a program in which the VA leases under-utilized real estate to the private sector for developing supportive housing and other services for homeless and at-risk veterans and their families.)  The bill provides that nothing in this bill shall be construed to: (1) authorize the VA to enter into an enhanced-use lease that authorizes the federal government to guarantee a third party loan to a lessee; and (2) abrogate or constitute a waiver of the sovereign immunity of the United States with respect to any financial agreement between a lessee and a third-party relating to an enhanced-use lease.  The annual report on enhanced-use leases shall include: (1) identification of VA actions taken to implement and administer such leases, and (2) lease amounts deposited into the Medical Care Collection Fund account and the VA's use of such funds.  Such report shall also include with respect to each enhanced-use lease: (1) an overview of the VA's use of consideration received to support veterans, (2) the amount of consideration received by the VA under or relating to the lease, and (3) the costs to the VA of carrying out the lease.  The bill defines \"major enhanced-use lease\" as an enhanced-use lease that includes more than $10 million in average annual rent.

The rules must also establish procedures for publishing on the FCC's website and submitting to Congress reports regarding: (1) the status of open rulemakings and items circulated for FCC commissioners' review; (2) the number of pending petitions, applications, complaints, and other requests for action by the FCC and the amount of time such requests have been pending; and (3) pending congressional investigations of the FCC and the cost of such investigations. The website postings and reports must be updated at least quarterly.  Performance measures must be included in notices of proposed rulemakings or orders that would create or substantially change a program activity. A \"program activity\" is a specific activity or project as listed in the program and financing schedules of the U.S. annual budget, including any annual collection or distribution or related series of collections or distributions by the FCC of $100 million or more.  The FCC must seek public comment on whether it should establish procedures to: (1) allow a bipartisan majority of commissioners to place items on an open meeting agenda; (2) publish in advance of open meetings the text of agenda items on which the FCC will vote; (3) ensure that commissioners have adequate time, prior to a required decision, to review the proposed decision document, including the specific rule or any proposed amendments; (4) provide deadlines for the disposition of certain license applications; and (5) publish orders, decisions, reports, and actions within 30 days after adoption.  The Government Accountability Office must audit the FCC's estimates of the costs of congressional investigations of the FCC.  The FCC must initiate a new rulemaking proceeding every five years to continue its consideration of procedural rule changes.  A bipartisan majority of commissioners may hold a nonpublic meeting, including a meeting to collaborate with joint boards or conferences, if: (1) no votes or actions are taken, and (2) an attorney from the FCC's Office of General Counsel is present. Such a closed meeting must be disclosed within two business days after the meeting, along with a list of persons in attendance and a summary of discussed matters, provided that such matters are not classified or otherwise exempt from disclosure.  The FCC must provide on its website: (1) information regarding the FCC's budget, appropriations, and total number of full-time equivalent employees; (2) the FCC's annual performance plan; and (3) information about consumer complaints in a publicly available, searchable database.  The chair of the FCC must also publish on the website policies established by the chair that relate to the FCC's functioning or its agenda.  The FCC must complete actions necessary for the required publication of documents in the Federal Register within specified time frames.  The FCC must inform the public about its performance and efficiency in meeting disclosure and other requirements under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), including by: (1) publishing on the FCC website its logs for managing FOIA requests and associated fees, (2) releasing decisions to grant or deny requests, and (3) presenting information about the number of FOIA requests received and granted or denied by the FCC in its annual budget estimates and annual performance and financial reports.  By January 15 of each year, the FCC must publish on its website and in other required formats an anticipated release schedule for all statistical reports and reports to Congress.  The bill requires annual reports to Congress on the FCC's performance in conducting its proceedings and meeting the deadlines and guidelines established by this bill.  (Sec. 102) In compiling its quarterly report with respect to informal consumer inquiries and complaints, the FCC is prohibited from categorizing an inquiry or complaint under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (places restrictions on telephone solicitations and automatic dialing systems) as a wireline or wireless inquiry or complaint unless a wireline or wireless carrier was the subject of the inquiry or complaint.  (Sec. 104) The Universal Service Antideficiency Temporary Suspension Act is amended to extend through 2020 the waiver of certain limitations on: (1) expending, obligating, or apportioning appropriations with respect to federal universal service contributions collected or received under the Communications Act of 1934; and (2) expending or obligating funds attributable to such contributions for universal service support programs.  (Sec. 105) The FCC must consult with the Small Business Administration to report to Congress with actions and recommendations to improve participation of small businesses in FCC proceedings.  (Sec. 106) For items adopted by an FCC vote, the FCC must publish on its website the text of the adopted items within 24 hours after the FCC Secretary has received all dissenting statements from commissioners. TITLE II--FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION CONSOLIDATED REPORTING (Sec. 201) This title replaces various reporting requirements with a communications marketplace report that the FCC is required to publish on its website and submit to Congress every two years assessing: (1) competition in the communications marketplace; (2) deployment of communications capabilities, including whether advanced telecommunications capability is being deployed to all Americans in a reasonable and timely fashion; and (3) whether laws, regulations, or regulatory practices pose a barrier to competitive entry or expansion of existing providers of communications services.  The report must describe the FCC's actions in the marketplace and its agenda for the next two years.  The FCC must: (1) compile a list of geographic areas that are not served by any provider of advanced telecommunications capability; and (2) consider market entry barriers for entrepreneurs and small businesses in accordance with national policy favoring diversity of media voices, competition, technological advancement, and promotion of the public interest, convenience, and necessity.  The FCC's competition assessments must include the aggregate average total amount paid by cable systems for retransmission consent.  (Sec. 202) The title repeals or consolidates various reports of the FCC and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, including reports on satellite competition, international broadband, video programming, cable industry prices, small business entry barriers, commercial mobile radio, services to minority and diverse audiences, waivers from requirements prohibiting FCC employees from being financially interested in companies subject to FCC regulation, and several other existing reports.  The Telecommunications Act of 1996 is amended to require the FCC to determine from the communications marketplace report every two years (currently, in an inquiry initiated each year) whether it must act immediately to accelerate deployment of advanced telecommunications capabilities, particularly in elementary and secondary schools, by removing barriers to infrastructure investment and promoting competition.  TITLE III--SMALL BUSINESS BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT (Sec. 301) This title exempts for five years after enactment of this bill any small business broadband Internet access service provider with no more than 250,000 subscribers from the FCC's enhancements to a transparency rule that requires persons engaged in the provision of broadband Internet access service to disclose publicly accurate information regarding the network management practices, performance, and commercial terms of its services sufficient for:   consumers to make informed choices regarding their use; and  content, application, service, and device providers to develop, market, and maintain Internet offerings.   The FCC shall report its recommendations on whether:   this exception should be made permanent, and  the definition of \"small business\" for these purposes should be modified.  TITLE IV--KARI'S LAW Kari's Law Act of 2016 (Sec. 402) This title prohibits businesses from manufacturing or importing for use in the United States, or selling or leasing in the United States, a multi-line telephone system unless it is pre-configured to allow users to directly initiate a call to 9-1-1 (without dialing any additional digit, code, prefix, or post-fix, including any trunk-access code such as the digit \"9\") from any station equipped with dialing facilities.  Businesses are prohibited from installing, managing, or operating multi-line telephone systems without such a direct 9-1-1 call configuration.  Businesses installing, managing, or operating such systems for use in the United States must configure the systems to provide a notification to a central location at the facility where the system is installed, or to another person or organization regardless of location, if the system is able to be so configured without an improvement to the hardware or software.  TITLE V--SECURING ACCESS TO NETWORKS IN DISASTERS (Sec. 501) This title requires the FCC to submit to Congress and publish on the FCC website a study on the public safety benefits, technical feasibility, and cost of providing the public with access to 9-1-1 services during times of emergency when mobile service is unavailable, through:   telecommunications service provider-owned WiFi access points and other communications technologies operating on unlicensed spectrum, without requiring any login credentials;  non-telecommunications service provider-owned WiFi access points; and  other alternative means.   The types of emergencies subject to this bill are: (1) occasions or instances under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act for which the President determines that federal assistance is needed to supplement state and local efforts and capabilities to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety, or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in any part of the United States; or (2) an emergency declared by the governor of a state or U.S. territory.  (Sec. 502) The Stafford Act is amended to expand the categories of essential service providers that may access a disaster site to restore and repair essential services in an emergency or major disaster without being denied or impeded by a federal agency. Services to be considered essential are wireline or mobile telephone service, Internet access service, radio or television broadcasting, cable service, or direct broadcast satellite service.  TITLE VI--SPOOFING PREVENTION (Sec. 601) This title expands the prohibition against knowingly transmitting misleading or inaccurate caller identification information to apply to: (1) persons outside the United States if the recipient is within the United States, and (2) text messages.  Existing caller identification requirements that apply to calls made using a telecommunications service or IP-enabled voice service are revised to apply to: (1) services interconnected with the public switched telephone network and that furnish voice communications using resources from the North American Numbering Plan; and (2) transmissions from a telephone facsimile machine, computer, or other device to a telephone facsimile machine.  The FCC must coordinate with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to regularly update education materials that help consumers identify: (1) scams and fraudulent activity that rely upon misleading or inaccurate caller identification information, and (2) existing technologies that consumers can use to protect against such fraud.  The GAO must report on: (1) actions taken, or actions that could be taken, by the FCC or the FTC to combat the fraudulent provision of misleading or inaccurate caller identification information; and (2) any recommendations to combat the fraudulent provision of such information.  TITLE VII--AMATEUR RADIO PARITY (Sec. 701) This title directs the FCC to amend station antenna structure regulations to prohibit a private land use restriction from applying to amateur radio stations if the restriction:   precludes communications in an amateur radio service,  fails to permit a licensee of amateur radio service to install and maintain an effective outdoor antenna on property under its exclusive use or control, or  is not the minimum practicable restriction to accomplish the lawful purposes of a community association seeking to enforce the restriction.  The FCC must require an amateur radio licensee to obtain prior approval from a community association before installing an outdoor antenna. A community association may: (1) prohibit installations on common property not under the exclusive control of the licensee, and (2) establish installation rules for amateur radio antennas and support structures. TITLE VIII--IMPROVING RURAL CALL QUALITY AND RELIABILITY (Sec. 801) This title requires intermediate providers that offer the capability to transmit voice communications and signaling information from one destination to another, and that charge a rate to any other entity (including an affiliated entity) for the transmission, to: (1) register with the FCC, and (2) comply with service quality standards to be established by the FCC.  An \"intermediate provider\" is an entity that: (1) enters a business arrangement with a long-distance voice service provider that makes the initial call path choice for more than 100,000 domestic retail subscriber lines, or with another intermediate provider, to carry, route, or transmit voice traffic from a call placed from or to an end user connection using a North American Numbering Plan resource; and (2) does not itself (directly or in conjunction with an affiliate) serve as such a long-distance initial call path choice provider in the context of originating or terminating a given call.  The title prohibits such long-distance providers (including local exchange carriers, interexchange carriers, commercial mobile radio services, interconnected voice over Internet Protocol [VoIP] services, and certain non-interconnected VoIP services) from using an intermediate provider to transmit voice communications and signals unless the intermediate provider is so registered.  The FCC must: (1) ensure the integrity of the transmission of voice communications to all customers in the United States, (2) prevent unjust or unreasonable discrimination among areas of the United States in the delivery of such voice communications, and (3) make a registry of intermediate providers publicly available on the FCC website.  This title shall not be construed to preempt or expand the authority of a state agency or public utility commission to collect data, or enforce state law and regulations, regarding the completion of intrastate voice communications.  Certain long-distance providers that make initial call path choices are exempt from service quality standards that the FCC is required to establish under this title if they certify under a safe harbor provision in existing FCC rules that they monitor the performance of, or do not use, intermediate providers.", "summary_short": "Communications Act Update Act of 2016 TITLE I--FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION PROCESS REFORM (Sec. 101) This bill amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to complete a rulemaking proceeding to adopt rules establishing:   minimum comment and reply periods for rulemakings;  policies to ensure that the public has notice and an opportunity to respond to comments, ex parte communications, or materials submitted toward the end of, or after, th...", "latest_major_action_date": "2016-09-28", "latest_major_action": "Message on House action received in Senate and at desk: House amendments to Senate bill."}, {"bill_id": "hr5391-114", "bill_slug": "hr5391", "bill_type": "hr", "number": "H.R.5391", "bill_uri": "https://api.propublica.org/congress/v1/114/bills/hr5391.json", "title": "To amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to enhance certain duties of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, and for other purposes.", "short_title": "Gains in Global Nuclear Detection Architecture Act", "sponsor_title": "Rep.", "sponsor_id": "R000588", "sponsor_name": "Cedric Richmond", "sponsor_state": "LA", "sponsor_party": "D", "sponsor_uri": "https://api.propublica.org/congress/v1/members/R000588.json", "gpo_pdf_uri": null, "congressdotgov_url": "https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5391", "govtrack_url": "https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr5391", "introduced_date": "2016-06-07", "active": true, "last_vote": null, "house_passage": "2016-09-27", "senate_passage": null, "enacted": null, "vetoed": null, "cosponsors": 0, "cosponsors_by_party": {}, "committees": "Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee", "committee_codes": ["SSGA", "HSHM"], "subcommittee_codes": [], "primary_subject": "Emergency Management", "summary": "(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced.

A claim of common law privilege by an agency, or an agency employee, shall not prevent the OSC from obtaining such materials.

The OSC may not respond to inquiries about a person who makes a disclosure, except in accordance with information privacy procedures or as required by law.

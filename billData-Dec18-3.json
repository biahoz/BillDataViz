A high-level drug offense involves a very substantial drug quantity (e.g., one kilogram or more of heroin). Additionally, the bill limits the prior convictions which trigger the enhanced mandatory minimum prison terms. A court may apply the reductions retroactively, after considering certain factors. (Sec. 102) It amends the federal criminal code to expand safety valve eligibility to permit a court to impose a sentence below the mandatory minimum for certain nonviolent, cooperative drug defendants with a limited criminal history.  (Sec. 103) A court may impose a reduced 5-year (instead of a statutory 10-year) mandatory minimum prison term for certain nonviolent, cooperative defendants convicted of a high-level first-time or low-level repeat drug offense. A low-level drug offense involves a substantial drug quantity (e.g., 100 grams to 999 grams of heroin).  (Sec. 104) The bill reduces from 25 to 15 years the enhanced mandatory minimum prison term for a defendant who uses a firearm in a crime of violence or drug offense after a prior conviction for such offense. A court may apply the reductions retroactively, after considering certain factors.  (Sec. 105) It reduces from 15 to 10 years the enhanced mandatory minimum prison term for an armed career criminal convicted of unlawful firearm possession after three prior convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses. A court may apply the reductions retroactively, after considering certain factors.  (Sec. 106) The Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 applies retroactively to allow a court to reduce the prison term of a convicted crack cocaine offender sentenced before August 3, 2010.  (Sec. 107) It amends the federal criminal code to create a 10-year mandatory minimum prison term for interstate domestic violence that results in a victim's death. (Sec. 108) The bill amends the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to create a five-year mandatory minimum prison term for providing goods and services to terrorists or a state sponsor of terrorism, to any person in connection with development of weapons of mass destruction, or to a country subject to an arms embargo.  (Sec. 109) The Department of Justice (DOJ) must report to Congress on and publish all federal criminal statutory offenses. Each executive agency must report to Congress on and publish all criminal regulatory offenses enforceable by the agency.  TITLE II--CORRECTIONS ACT  Corrections Oversight, Recidivism Reduction, and Eliminating Costs for Taxpayers In Our National System Act of 2015 or the CORRECTIONS Act  (Sec. 202) DOJ must review existing recidivism reduction programs and productive activities (e.g., a prison work program). The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) must expand offerings to all eligible prisoners. Certain prisoners who successfully complete a recidivism reduction program or productive activity are eligible to earn time credits and other incentives (e.g., additional telephone or visitation privileges).  (Sec. 203) DOJ must develop the Post-Sentencing Risk and Needs Assessment System for use by the BOP to assess prisoner recidivism and violence risk and ensure appropriate housing, grouping, and program assignments.  (Sec. 204) The bill amends the federal criminal code to allow pre-release custody for an additional period of time equal to a prisoner's earned time credits for successful completion of recidivism reduction programs or productive activities. A prisoner may serve the additional period of pre-release custody in a residential reentry center, on home confinement, or on community supervision. (Sec. 205) DOJ must report to Congress on: (1) activities carrying out this title, including any budgetary savings; (2) prison work programs; (3) recidivism rates of released prisoners; and (4) effectiveness of recidivism reduction programs and productive activities on various prisoner categories.  (Sec. 206) The bill requires presentence investigation reports to include certain information such as substance abuse history, military service, and veteran status. The Administrative Office of the United States Courts must establish a supervised release pilot program to reduce recidivism and improve substance abuse recovery.  (Sec. 207) The BOP must issue pepper spray to its officers and employees for use in reducing violent acts.  (Sec. 208) DOJ must: (1) evaluate reentry best practices and create reentry demonstration projects in judicial districts, and (2) report on reentry impact in communities disproportionately affected.  (Sec. 209) A court may reduce the prison term and impose supervised release for a defendant convicted as an adult for an offense committed as a juvenile if the defendant has served 20 years in custody and the court, after considering certain factors, determines that release poses no public safety danger. (Sec. 210) It amends the Second Chance Act of 2007 to make permanent a pilot program for elderly offender early release and expand program eligibility to include terminally ill offenders. The bill modifies elderly offender eligibility criteria by lowering from 65 to 60 the qualifying age and reducing from 75% to two-thirds the required portion of completed prison term. An eligible terminally ill offender is a nonviolent offender who meets specified criteria and is either terminally ill or at a nursing home.  (Sec. 211) This bill establishes a process to seal and expunge juvenile records related to a juvenile nonviolent offense. A juvenile record includes a court, law enforcement, or government agency record. A juvenile nonviolent offense is a criminal offense or firearm violation committed before age 18 that is not a violent offense, terrorism, or misdemeanor domestic violence. A court must automatically seal the juvenile records of a juvenile nonviolent offender (i.e., a person adjudicated delinquent for a juvenile nonviolent offense) three years after such offender completes probation, detention, or supervision. Seal means to close from public viewing and physically seal shut. A court must provide notice of automatic sealing and the benefits of such sealing. The bill creates a process for a juvenile nonviolent offender to petition for early sealing of such records. It prohibits intentional disclosure of a sealed juvenile record, except in specified circumstances, and subjects a violator to a fine, up to one year in prison, or both. A law enforcement agency may access sealed records to determine first-time-offender diversion program eligibility, for investigatory or prosecutorial purposes, or for background checks.  A court must automatically expunge the juvenile records related to: (1) a juvenile nonviolent offender who commits an offense before age 15 and completes probation, detention, or supervision before age 18 on the date such offender attains age 18; (2) a juvenile who is arrested but not adjudicated for a juvenile nonviolent offense; and (3) a juvenile who is adjudicated and found not delinquent. Expunge means to destroy a record and obliterate from the public record the name to whom such record pertains. A court must provide notice of automatic expungement and the benefits of such expungement. A juvenile nonviolent offender who commits an offense on or after age 15 may petition to expunge related juvenile records. The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts must create a universal expungement petition form. A court must provide notice, conduct a hearing, and grant or deny the petition after considering specified factors. It must appoint counsel for nonviolent juvenile offender who has not attained age 18.  If a court orders the sealing or expungement of a juvenile record, then related proceedings are deemed never to have occurred. (Sec. 212) It prohibits juvenile solitary confinement, except as a temporary response to behavior that poses a serious and immediate risk of harm.  (Sec. 213) The bill amends the federal judicial code to require DOJ to establish and report to Congress on procedures for the prompt release of accurate criminal and arrest records exchanged for employment-related purposes through the Federal Bureau of Investigation background check system. It sets forth required procedures, including requirements for DOJ to: (1) promptly correct inaccurate records; (2) complete or verify incomplete records; (3) notify reporting jurisdiction of any action to correct, complete, or verify an inaccurate or incomplete record; and (4) notify a job applicant of the right to obtain and review a record, and provide an opportunity for such applicant to challenge the record's accuracy and completeness.  Additionally, it prohibits from inclusion in an employment-related exchange records related to: (1) an arrest more than two years old that was not disposed of; (2) a nonserious offense such as drunkenness, vagrancy, disturbing the peace, loitering, or curfew violation; or (3) a circumstance that is not clearly an arrest or disposition of an arrest.

This bill requires: (1) law enforcement agencies that purchase equipment for SWAT teams to publish training records for such teams; (2) states to establish whistle blower protections and public complaint hot lines for reporting misuse of any military equipment purchased with Byrne grant funds; and (3) grant funds to be allocated for the purchase of body cameras, dashboard cameras, gun cameras, and related costs.  DOJ must: (1) collect and analyze data on the use of SWAT teams by federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies; and (2) publish and report on such data.

Amends the Public Health Service Act to revise a community children and violence program to assist local communities and schools in applying a public health approach to mental health services, including by: (1) revising eligibility requirements for a grant, contract, or cooperative agreement; and (2) providing for comprehensive school mental health programs that are culturally and linguistically appropriate, trauma-informed, and age appropriate. Requires a comprehensive school mental health program funded under this Act to assist children in dealing with trauma and violence. Makes only a partnership between a local educational agency and at least one community program or agency that is involved in mental health eligible for such funding.  Sets forth assurances required for eligibility, including that: (1) the local education agency will enter into a memorandum of understanding with at least one relevant community-based entity that clearly states how school-employed mental health professionals will be utilized and the responsibilities of each partner; (2) the program will include training of all school personnel, family members of children with mental health disorders, and concerned members of the community; and (3) the program will demonstrate the measures to be taken to sustain the program after funding terminates.  Requires grantees to comply with the health information privacy requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Requires the Administrator of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to develop a fiscally appropriate process for evaluating grant program activities, including: (1) the development of guidelines for the submission of program data by recipients; and (2) the development of measures of outcomes to be applied by recipients in evaluating programs, to include student and family measures and local educational measures.  Amends the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act of 2004 to: (1) expand the assistance provided under such Act, and (2) reauthorize appropriations for FY2015-FY2019.  Authorizes the Attorney General to award grants to establish or expand: (1) veterans treatment court programs, which involve collaboration among criminal justice, veterans, and mental health and substance abuse agencies to provide qualified veterans (preliminarily qualified offenders who were discharged from the armed forces under conditions other than dishonorable) with intensive judicial supervision and case management, treatment services, alternatives to incarceration, and other appropriate services, including housing, transportation, job training, education, and assistance in obtaining benefits; (2) peer to peer services or programs to assist such veterans in obtaining treatment, recovery, stabilization, or rehabilitation; (3) practices that identify and provide treatment, rehabilitation, legal, transitional, and other appropriate services to such veterans who have been incarcerated; and (4) training programs to teach criminal justice, law enforcement, corrections, mental health, and substance abuse personnel how to identify and respond to incidents involving such veterans.  Revises the definition of \"preliminarily qualified offender\" to include, for purposes of a veterans treatment court program, an adult or juvenile accused of an offense who has been diagnosed with, or manifests obvious signs of, mental illness or a substance abuse disorder or co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse disorder. Removes a requirement that the adult or juvenile be accused of a nonviolent offense. Requires preliminarily qualified offenders to be unanimously approved for participation in a collaboration program by, when appropriate, the relevant prosecuting attorney, defense attorney, probation or corrections official, judge, and representative from the relevant mental health agency.  Authorizes the Attorney General to award grants to enhance the capabilities of a correctional facility to: (1) identify and screen for mentally ill inmates; (2) plan and provide assessments of the clinical, medical, and social needs of inmates and appropriate treatment and services that address mental health and substance abuse needs; (3) develop, implement, and enhance post-release transition plans that coordinate services and public benefits, the availability of mental health care and substance abuse treatment services, alternatives to solitary confinement and segregated housing, and mental health screening and treatment for inmates placed in solitary confinement or segregated housing; and (4) train employees in identifying and responding to incidents involving inmates with mental health disorders or co-occurring mental health and substance abuse disorders.  Authorizes the Attorney General to: (1) award not more than six grants per year to applicants for the purpose of reducing the use of public services by mentally ill individuals who consume a significantly disproportionate quantity of public resources, and (2) make grants to provide support for programs that teach law enforcement personnel how to identify and respond to incidents involving persons with such disorders. Directs the Attorney General to give priority in awarding grants for adult or juvenile collaboration programs to applications that: (1) propose interventions that have been shown by empirical evidence to reduce recidivism, and (2) use validated assessment tools to target preliminarily qualified offenders with a moderate or high risk of recidivism and a need for treatment and services. Title II: Improving Mental Health Research - Directs the Secretary to expand research on self-directed and other-directed violence associated with mental illness. Title III: Understanding the Epidemic of Gun Violence - Requires the Secretary to expand: (1) the National Violent Death Reporting System to all 50 states, and (2) research and grants of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to address gun violence. Authorizes FY2015-FY2019 appropriations for CDC research and grants. Title IV: Mental Health and Access to Firearms - Amends federal criminal code prohibitions on the sale, purchase, transport, or possession of firearms or ammunition to specify that prohibitions with respect to persons committed to a mental institution apply to persons committed on an involuntary inpatient or involuntary outpatient basis.

Revises the definition of \"preliminarily qualified offender\" to include, in the case of a veterans treatment court program, an adult or juvenile accused of an offense who has been diagnosed with, or manifests obvious signs of, mental illness or a substance abuse disorder or co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse disorder. Removes a requirement that the adult or juvenile be accused of a nonviolent offense. Requires preliminarily qualified offenders to be unanimously approved for participation in a collaboration program by, when appropriate, the relevant prosecuting attorney, defense attorney, probation or corrections official, judge, and representative from the relevant mental health agency.  Authorizes the Attorney General to award grants to enhance the capabilities of a correctional facility to: (1) identify and screen for mentally ill inmates; (2) plan and provide assessments of the clinical, medical, and social needs of inmates and appropriate treatment and services that address mental health and substance abuse needs; (3) develop, implement, and enhance post-release transition plans that coordinate services and public benefits, the availability of mental health care and substance abuse treatment services, alternatives to solitary confinement and segregated housing, and mental health screening and treatment for inmates placed in solitary confinement or segregated housing; and (4) train employees in identifying and responding to incidents involving inmates with mental health disorders or co-occurring mental health and substance abuse disorders.

Expands the definition of: (1) \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" to include offenses by children, grandparents, grandchildren, siblings, or dating partners; and (2) \"intimate partner\" to include such individuals as well as parents and guardians.

Establishes minimum requirements for coal combustion residuals permit programs. Requires: (1) the revised criteria established by this Act to apply to such programs; (2) landfills, surface impoundments, or other land-based units that may receive coal combustion residuals (structures) to be designed, constructed, and maintained to provide for containment of the maximum volumes of coal combustion residuals appropriate for the structure; (3) such programs to apply such revised criteria to surface impoundments; and (4) new structures that first receive coal combustion residuals after this Act's enactment to be constructed with a base located a minimum of two feet above the upper limit of the natural water table. Authorizes states to: (1) require action to correct structural integrity deficiencies according to a schedule for structures that are classified as posing a high hazard potential pursuant to the guidelines published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) entitled \"Federal Guidelines for Dam Safety: Hazard Potential Classification System for Dams,\" (2) require that such a structure close if such deficiency is not corrected according to such schedule, (3) inspect structures and implement and enforce such permit program, and (4) address wind dispersal of dust from coal combustion residuals by requiring dust control measures. Sets forth revised criteria for such programs with respect to: (1) design, groundwater monitoring, corrective action, and closure and post-closure for structures; (2) location restrictions for new structures in floodplains, wetlands, fault areas, seismic impact zones, and unstable areas; (3) air quality, financial assurance, surface water, and record keeping; (4) run-on and run-off control systems for landfills and other land-based units, other than surface impoundments that receive coal combustion residuals; and (5) run-off control systems for surface impoundments. Authorizes states to determine that such criteria is not needed for the management of their coal combustion residuals permit program. Authorizes the Administrator to treat such state determination as a deficiency if it does not accurately reflect the needs for the management of coal combustion residuals in the state. Requires the time period and method for a structure's closure to be set forth in a schedule in a closure plan that takes into account the site-specific characteristics. Directs the closure plan for a surface impoundment to require the removal of liquid and the stabilization of remaining waste as necessary to support the final cover. Prohibits the Administrator from applying such programs to the utilization, placement, and storage of coal combustion residuals at surface mining and reclamation operations.

Defines \"call detail records\" as communications routing information. Prohibits the federal government from acquiring under FISA: (1) records of any electronic communication without the use of specific identifiers or selection terms; or (2) library circulation records, library patron lists, book sales records, book customer lists, firearm sales records, tax return records, educational records, or medical records containing information that would identify a person without the use of specific identifiers or selection terms. Authorizes the FISA court or the FISA court of review to appoint amicus curiae to assist in the consideration of certain FISA applications.  Expands the categories of FISA court decisions, orders, or opinions that the Attorney General (DOJ) is required to submit to Congress within 45 days after issuance of the decision, to include: (1) a denial or modification of a request for an order under FISA; and (2) a change of the application, or a new application, of any FISA provision. Directs the Attorney General to include with such court documents a brief statement of the relevant background factual information, questions of law, legal analysis, and decision rendered. Requires the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to: (1) conduct a declassification review of each decision, order, or opinion issued by the FISA court and the FISA court of review that includes a significant construction or interpretation of FISA; and (2) make such documents publicly available to the greatest extent practicable, subject to permissible redactions. Authorizes the DNI to waive such review and public availability requirements if: (1) a waiver is necessary to protect the national security or properly classified intelligence sources or methods, and (2) an unclassified summary is made publicly available. Requires the Attorney General to make available to the public an annual report describing the number of instances in which the contents of a U.S. person's communication were acquired under FISA authorities that could not reasonably have been anticipated to capture such contents.  Amends the National Security Act of 1947 to require the DNI to report annually to Congress regarding violations of laws or executive orders by personnel of an element of the intelligence community, including violations of Executive Order 12333 relating to U.S. intelligence activities. Directs each head of an element of the intelligence community to review, at least every five years, the Attorney General-approved procedures required by the intelligence collection provisions of such Executive Order. Requires the heads of such elements, in coordination with the Attorney General and DNI, to propose any appropriate modifications to existing procedures and to provide any modified procedures to Congress. Establishes procedures under which the Attorney General and the DNI may authorize jointly, for up to one year, the acquisition from an electronic communication service provider (ECSP) of certain communications records pertaining to a foreign power if: (1) the FISA court issues an order approving a certification, submitted to the court by the Attorney General and the DNI, that attests to the use of appropriate selection procedures and privacy protections; or (2) the Attorney General and the DNI, before obtaining FISA court approval, make a determination that time does not permit the issuance of a FISA court order because exigent circumstances exist that may result in the loss or untimely acquisition of intelligence important to national security. Authorizes the Attorney General and the DNI, upon obtaining a FISA court order or making such an exigent circumstances determination, to acquire from an ECSP records created as a result of communications of an individual or facility that, based on reasonable and articulable suspicion, is: (1) a foreign power or the agent of a foreign power; (2) associated with a foreign power or the agent of a foreign power; or (3) in contact with, or known to, a suspected agent of a foreign power. Requires any such acquisition to be reasonably designed not to acquire: (1) the contents associated with any communication; (2) records of wire or electronic communications without the use of specific identifiers or selection terms; or (3) the name, address, social security number, employer or taxpayer identification number, date of birth, or credit card number of any U.S. person. Directs the Attorney General and the DNI, in the case of an acquisition under exigent circumstances before obtaining the FISA court's approval, to submit a certification to the FISA court for authorization within seven days after such determination.  Allows the Attorney General and the DNI, with respect to an acquisition approved by the FISA court or authorized under exigent circumstances, to issue a directive requiring an ECSP to provide to the government records that exist or are created in the future. Requires the government to compensate ECSPs for providing such records. Directs the Attorney General to provide the FISA court a copy of each acquisition directive submitted to an ECSP. Permits the FISA court, if it determines that the selection procedures in a directive are improper, to order that the production of records be terminated or modified, that the information produced be destroyed, or another appropriate remedy. Allows ECSPs to file a petition with the FISA court to modify or set aside a directive. Permits the government or an ECSP to file a petition seeking Supreme Court review of a decision of the FISA court of review. Prohibits procedures for issuing such directives from being construed to prevent a directive from requiring an ECSP to produce additional records, whether existing or created in the future, based on records produced by a previous directive. Directs the DNI to: (1) ensure that employees, officers, and contractors of each element of the intelligence community who have been determined eligible for access to classified information are monitored on a continual basis to determine whether they continue to meet eligibility requirements; (2) require information sharing between elements of the community concerning potentially derogatory security information that may impact such an individual's security clearance eligibility. Requires the DNI to ensure that contracts awarded by elements of the intelligence community require the contractor to operate under a security plan that complies with DNI standards for intelligence community networks.", "summary_short": "FISA Transparency and Modernization Act - Amends the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) to exclude call detail records from the categories of items that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) may seek in an application to a FISA court for an order requiring the production of tangible things (commonly referred to as business records) for an investigation to obtain foreign intelligence information not concerning a U.S. person or to protect against international terrorism or...", "latest_major_action_date": "2014-04-16", "latest_major_action": "Referred to the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations."}, {"bill_id": "hr4380-113", "bill_slug": "hr4380", "bill_type": "hr", "number": "H.R.4380", "bill_uri": "https://api.propublica.org/congress/v1/113/bills/hr4380.json", "title": "To prohibit gun confiscation and registration.", "short_title": "Gun Confiscation and Registration Prevention Act", "sponsor_title": "Rep.", "sponsor_id": "S000937", "sponsor_name": "Steve Stockman", "sponsor_state": "TX", "sponsor_party": "R", "sponsor_uri": "https://api.propublica.org/congress/v1/members/S000937.json", "gpo_pdf_uri": null, "congressdotgov_url": "https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4380", "govtrack_url": "https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr4380", "introduced_date": "2014-04-02", "active": false, "last_vote": null, "house_passage": null, "senate_passage": null, "enacted": null, "vetoed": null, "cosponsors": 2, "cosponsors_by_party": {"R": 2}, "committees": "House Judiciary Committee", "committee_codes": ["HSJU"], "subcommittee_codes": ["HSJU08"], "primary_subject": "Crime and Law Enforcement", "summary": "Gun Confiscation and Registration Prevention Act - Prohibits any of the funds made available through the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 or the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Program from being provided to any jurisdiction which: (1) maintains a registry of gun ownership, or (2) conducts a program of gun confiscation directed at any firearm which is not prohibited by federal law or any group of persons who are not prohibited from possessing a firearm under federal law.

Denies the District any authority to enact laws or regulations that discourage or eliminate the private ownership or use of firearms. Declares that nothing in such prohibitions shall be construed to prohibit the District from regulating the carrying of firearms by a person, either concealed or openly, other than at the person's dwelling place, place of business, or on other land possessed by the person. Amends the Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975 (FCRA) to repeal the definition of a machine gun as any firearm which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily converted or restored to shoot semiautomatically, more than 12 shots without manual reloading. (Thus repeals the ban on semiautomatic weapons.) Redefines \"machine gun\" as any firearm which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot automatically, more than one shot without manual reloading by a single function of the trigger. Includes also the frame or receiver of any such firearm, any part designed and intended solely and exclusively, or combination of parts designed and intended, for use in converting a firearm into a machine gun, and any combination of parts from which a machine gun can be assembled if such parts are in the possession or under the control of a person. Repeals the District's: (1) registration requirement for possession of firearms, and (2) requirement that licensed firearms dealers keep records of ammunition received into inventory and ammunition sold or transferred. Maintains the current ban on the possession and control of a sawed-off shotgun, machine gun, or short-barreled rifle. Permits a licensed firearms dealer to sell or transfer ammunition, excluding restricted pistol bullets, to persons not otherwise prohibited from possessing or receiving ammunition. Declares that, in the case of a sale or transfer of a handgun to a District resident, a federally licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer of firearms in Maryland or Virginia shall be treated as a dealer licensed under this Act if: (1) the transferee meets in person with the transferor to accomplish the transfer; and (2) the sale, delivery, and receipt fully comply with the legal conditions of sale in both the District and the jurisdiction in which the transfer occurs. Amends FCRA to allow an individual to possess ammunition in the District if the individual owns (currently, holds the valid registration certificate for) a firearm of the same gauge or caliber as such ammunition. (In effect, repeals the handgun ammunition ban.) Repeals the requirement that firearms in the possession of individuals (other than law enforcement personnel) must be kept unloaded, disassembled, or with the trigger locked, unless the firearm is kept at an individual's place of business, or while being used for lawful recreational purposes within the District . Continues current criminal penalties for allowing access of a minor (under age 16) to loaded firearms, except in specified circumstances. Repeals increased penalties for violations of the prohibition against allowing access of a minor to loaded firearms if injury or death results to the minor or another person. Requires the U.S. attorney, however, to consider both the extent of the minor's injuries and the effect of the minor's injury or death on both of the minor's parents when deciding whether to file charges. Prohibits any prosecution in such circumstances unless the person who committed the violation behaved in a grossly negligent manner, or unless similarly egregious circumstances exist. Eliminates criminal penalties for possessing an unregistered firearm. Amends the District of Columbia Code to: (1) allow private persons or entities owning property in the District to prohibit or restrict the possession of firearms on their property (other than authorized law enforcement personnel or lessees occupying residential or business premises), (2) prohibit unauthorized carrying of rifles or shotguns in the District, (3) authorize certain individuals to carry firearms in certain places and for certain purposes, (4) prescribe requirements for lawful transportation of firearms, and (5) prohibit the use of toy and antique pistols to commit a violent or dangerous crime. Authorizes the District of Columbia to prohibit or restrict the possession of firearms (except to lessees occupying residential or business premises) within any building or structure under its control, or in any area of it, which has implemented security measures to identify and exclude unauthorized or hazardous persons or articles. Amends the Office of Administrative Hearings Establishment Act of 2001 to grant jurisdiction to the Office of Administrative Hearings to hear cases pertaining to denial or revocation of firearm dealer licenses. Repeals provisions of FCRA that require a gun offender to register and to verify certain identifiable information with the District's Chief of Police. Defines \"gun offender\" as a person:   convicted at any time of a gun offense in the District;   convicted at any time of a gun offense who resides in the District within the registration period established under the Act; or  who has, as a mandatory condition of release, a registration requirement in the District certified by the District Superior Court.   Repeals:   the Firearms Registration Amendment Act of 2008,   the Inoperable Pistol Amendment Act of 2008, the Firearms Amendment Act of 2012, and the Administrative Disposition for Weapons Offenses Amendment Act of 2012.

Title I: College and Career Readiness for All Students - Part A: Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged - (Sec. 1111) Revises the school improvement program under part A of title I of the ESEA. Maintains the requirement conditioning a state's receipt of funds under part A on its developing and implementing academic content and achievement standards and assessments that are applicable to all public elementary and secondary schools and school students in the state. Requires states to adopt college and career ready academic: (1) content standards in reading or language arts and mathematics by the end of 2014, and (2) achievement standards in those disciplines by the beginning of the 2015-2016 school year.  Requires college and career ready standards to be aligned with: (1) credit-bearing academic coursework at public institutions of higher education (IHEs) in the state, (2) relevant state career and technical education standards and the state performance measures identified in the state plan for career and technical education, and (3) appropriate career skills or state-developed standards that are voluntarily adopted by a significant number of states. Requires the achievement standards to establish the level of performance expected for each grade level that demonstrates that the student has mastered the material in the state academic content standards for that grade level. Requires states to adopt academic content and achievement standards in science by the end of 2014 that are aligned with the knowledge and skills needed to be college and career ready. Requires states to adopt, by the close of 2015, high-quality English language proficiency standards that: (1) identify at least four levels of English proficiency, and (2) are aligned with their academic content standards in reading or language arts so that students can be reliably measured in those disciplines. Requires English learners (currently referred to as limited English proficient students) to be tested against those proficiency standards on an annual basis. Allows states to adopt alternate academic achievement standards and assessments for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities. Requires the decision about which students should be measured against these standards to be made separately for each student in each subject assessed. Prohibits the number of students in a state who are being assessed in each grade level for each subject using the alternate assessment from exceeding 1% of the number of all students in that grade level in the state being assessed in that subject matter.  Directs states that use school improvement funds to support early childhood education to establish, or certify the existence of, early learning guidelines for preschool-aged children and early grade standards for children in kindergarten through grade three by the close of 2015. Requires states, by the beginning of the 2015-2016 school year, to adopt and implement statewide assessments that measure student achievement against: (1) the reading or language arts and mathematics standards annually in grades 3 through 8 and at least once during grades 10 through 12; and (2) the science standards at least once in grades 3 through 5, 6 through 9, and 10 through 12; (3) the English language proficiency standards; and (4) any alternate academic achievement standards for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities.  Requires the assessments in reading or language arts, mathematics, and science to: (1) measure whether each student is performing at the student's grade level, (2) determine the specific grade level at which each student is performing, and (3) measure each student's academic growth. Allows states to develop and administer computer adaptive assessments for those subjects. Allows the assessments in reading or language arts and mathematics to be administered through a single annual summative assessment or through multiple assessments during an academic year, provided the multiple assessments yield a summative score that reliably measures student academic growth. Requires states to reduce duplicative assessments.  Requires each state receiving part A funds to prepare and disseminate an annual report card on the performance of each public elementary and secondary school in the state, each local educational agency (LEA) in the state, and the state as a whole. Requires the report cards to include: (1) specified student information in the aggregate and disaggregated and cross-tabulated by student subgroup, (2) class size information, (3) information on each school's categorization under the state accountability system, (4) school sports information, and (5) information on the number of students using early intervening services. Requires LEAs to issue report cards that contain specified student information disaggregated by student subgroup. Requires LEAs to provide parents with an equity report card for each school that includes: (1) student achievement data, disaggregated by student subgroup; (2) information on the school's funding by source; (3) for each high school, the graduation rate and the rate students enroll in college; (4) information on student participation in educational opportunities at the school; and (5) school climate information. (Sec. 1113) Alters the formula LEAs are to use to: (1) rank the poverty of school attendance areas if school improvement funds are insufficient to serve all areas, and (2) calculate the number of low-income students in secondary schools.  Requires LEAs to reserve part A funds to serve homeless and foster care children. Allows reserved funds to be used to provide homeless children and youth with services not ordinarily provided to other children under part A. (Sec. 1114) Amends provisions concerning schoolwide programs (programs that allow LEAs to consolidate school improvement funds to upgrade the entire educational program of schools) to allow the delivery of those programs by external providers that have expertise in using scientifically valid strategies and programs to improve teaching, learning, and schools. Requires schoolwide programs to include reform strategies that provide: (1) a multi-tier system of supports and positive behavioral interventions and supports; and (2) programs, activities, courses, and professional development in the core academic subjects that are targeted toward assisting low-performing or at-risk children in meeting the academic content and achievement standards. (Sec. 1115) Allows targeted assistance programs (programs that direct school improvement funds toward the children in a school who are failing or most at risk of failing) to include: (1) a multi-tier system of supports and positive behavioral interventions and supports; and (2) support for programs, activities, courses, and professional development in the core academic subjects that are targeted toward assisting those children in meeting the academic content and achievement standards. (Sec. 1116) Eliminates the requirement that LEAs and their elementary and secondary schools make adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward state performance standards or be subject to specified improvements, corrective action, or restructuring. Requires, instead, that each state accountability system:    establish annual performance targets for the state and its LEAs and elementary and secondary schools that include targets for student proficiency, academic growth, English language proficiency for English learners, and high school graduation rates;   use the assessments and high school graduation rates to annually measure and report on the performance of the state's elementary and secondary schools and LEAs; and  require the improvement, through supports and interventions that address student needs, of all of the state's public schools that are low-performing or have low-performing subgroups of poor, minority, disabled, and English learner students.  Requires state accountability systems to include student performance in reading or language arts and mathematics. Allows states to include other subjects, such as science, for which they have adopted academic content and achievement standards. Requires LEAs to ensure that each school that, after two consecutive years, has not met state performance targets for the same student subgroup develops and implements a locally designed intervention to improve student achievement in that subgroup. Subjects schools to improvement strategies if they are identified as: (1) focus schools due to their having among the largest achievement or graduation gaps among student subgroups in the state; or (2) priority schools due to their status as the lowest achieving schools in the state, high schools with graduation rates below 60%, or focus schools for the six preceding consecutive years.  Identifies a school as a focus school, beginning with the 2015-2016 school year, if it is not identified as a priority school and is in the 10% of all: (1) public schools in the state with the greatest achievement gaps among the subgroups of poor, minority, disabled, and English learner students; or (2) public high schools in the state with the greatest graduation rate gaps among those student subgroups. Requires each LEA that serves a focus school to develop and implement a measurable and data-driven correction plan to improve the performance of the school's low-achieving subgroups. Continues a focus school's characterization as a focus school for the three years following its designation as such, unless it meets all of its performance targets or the state determines, after the second year, that it will meet those targets by the end of the following year. Allows states to apply to the Secretary of Education (Secretary) for a waiver of the requirement to identify schools as focus schools if they determine that all of their schools that would be identified as such are performing at a satisfactory level. Identifies a school as a priority school, beginning with the 2015-2016 school year, if it: (1) is in the lowest-achieving 5% of elementary schools in the state, (2) is in the lowest-achieving 5% of secondary schools in the state, (3) is a public high school with a graduation rate of less than 60%, or (4) has been a focus school for the six preceding consecutive years. Allows states to apply to the Secretary for a waiver of the requirement to identify schools as priority schools due to their being within the lowest-achieving 5% of elementary or 5% of secondary schools if they determine that all of those schools are performing at a satisfactory level. Authorizes a state, state law permitting, to take over a school and act as its LEA if the school has been identified as a priority school for the initial three-year identification period and is then re-identified as a priority school for a subsequent three-year period. Requires LEAs receiving part A funds to conduct a data-driven needs analysis of each of their priority schools and use it to select and implement the most appropriate school improvement strategy to improve student performance at each school.  Requires LEAs that are implementing any of the school improvement strategies to provide: (1) school staff with ongoing training and performance evaluations; (2) students with instruction and instructional supports that meet their individual needs; and (3) the school with assistance in implementing positive behavioral interventions and supports, other early intervening services, and school based mental-health programs. Identifies the school improvement strategies as: (1) the transformation strategy, (2) the turnaround strategy, (3) the whole school reform strategy, (4) the restart strategy, and (5) the school closure strategy. Includes as part of the transformation strategy: (1) replacing the principal, if the principal has served in that role at the school for more than two years, with a principal that has had more training, experience, or success; (2) requiring instructional and leadership personnel to reapply for their positions; (3) requiring hiring at the school to be done through mutual consent; and (4) implementing schedules and strategies that provide increased learning time.  Includes as part of the turnaround strategy: (1) replacing the principal, if the principal has served in that role at the school for more than two years, with a principal that has had more training, experience, or success; (2) screening all teachers in the school and retaining not more than 65% of them; and (3) implementing schedules and strategies the provide increased learning time. Identifies the whole school reform strategy as one undertaken in partnership with an external provider offering a school reform program that is based on at least a moderate level of evidence that it will have a statistically significant effect on student outcomes.  Includes as part of the restart strategy: (1) converting the school into a public charter, magnet, or innovative school; (2) allowing students of the former school to enroll in the new school; and (3) using a random lottery system to admit additional students if the new school has more applicants than it can accommodate. Requires LEAs implementing the school closure strategy to enroll students who attended the closed school in higher-performing schools that are within reasonable proximity to the closed school. Allows school improvement funds to be used to support the costs the higher-performing schools incur in meeting the needs of these new students.  Allows states, with the Secretary's approval, to establish an alternative state-determined, evidence-based, school improvement strategy to be used by their LEAs, but prohibits funds under title I of the ESEA from being used for school vouchers. Continues a priority school's characterization as a priority school for the three years following its designation as such, unless, after the second year, it has met all of its performance targets or the state determines that it will meet those targets by the end of the following year.  Requires LEAs to: (1) implement the restart or school closure strategy for schools that are re-classified as priority schools after their initial classification as such; and (2) allow students at priority schools to transfer to another public school that has not been identified as persistently low-achieving, unless that option is prohibited by state law. (Sec. 1117) Repeals the school support and recognition program (a program that requires states to establish a statewide system of intensive and sustained support and improvement for LEAs and schools to increase the opportunity for students to meet the state's academic content and student academic achievement standards). Requires teachers teaching a core academic subject in a program supported with school improvement funds to be highly qualified and certified to teach that subject area, but makes this requirement applicable only to new teachers if the state has fully implemented a professional growth and improvement system. Allows LEAs that are unable to provide a small, rural, or remote school with a highly-qualified, on-site, classroom teacher for a core academic subject to use distance education provided by a teacher highly qualified in the subject, but only if a teacher highly qualified in another subject is present in the classroom to assist students during the distance education. Excepts teachers of American Indian, Alaska Native, or Native Hawaiian language, culture, or history from the requirement that teachers be highly qualified. Allows states to require a local tribe or tribal organization to verify those teachers' competency. Prohibits a state from requiring a school or LEA to spend a specific amount of funds for professional development activities under part A. (Sec. 1118) Requires LEAs to conduct an annual survey of parents, family members, and school personnel and, on the basis of that survey, develop and implement an annual parent and family engagement plan to support the meaningful engagement of parents and other family members in children's education. Provides that each plan shall establish parent engagement goals for the LEA and its schools and annual quantifiable performance benchmarks for such goals. Requires LEAs to conduct an end-of-the-year survey of parents and school personnel and, on the basis of that survey and their progress in meeting their annual performance benchmarks, revise their parent and family engagement plan as needed. Directs LEAs to: (1) establish a parent advisory board to assist them in developing, revising, and reviewing their parent and family engagement plan; and (2) reserve at least 2% of their part A allocation to assist schools in carrying out activities pursuant to that plan. (Sec. 1120) Conditions an LEA's receipt of part A funds, beginning with the 2015-2016 school year, on the LEA showing its state that combined state and local per-pupil expenditures in each of its schools served under part A are not less than the average combined state and local per-pupil expenditures for each of its schools not served under that program. Requires an LEA that serves all of its schools under part A to show its state that the average combined state and local per-pupil expenditures for its high-poverty schools were not less than those expenditures for its low-poverty schools. Allows LEAs to meet these requirements on an LEA-wide or grade-span by grade-span basis. Requires LEAs to exclude from these calculations state and local funds expended in any school for capital expenditures or the excess costs of providing services to English learners or disabled children. Allows LEAs to satisfy comparability of education expenditure requirements by meeting expenditure requirements enacted by the state or LEA before this Act's enactment, provided those requirements provide the same or a higher standard of comparability than this Act's provisions. (Sec. 1121) Requires LEAs to engage in specified activities with Head Start agencies, special education providers, and, if feasible, other early childhood education providers to ease the transition of children into elementary education. (Sec. 1125) Replaces the school support and recognition program with a blue ribbon schools program that allows each state to annually identify the highest 5% of its schools as blue ribbon schools based on: (1) the percentage of their students who are meeting or exceeding state academic achievement standards in English or language arts and mathematics; (2) in the case of high schools, their graduation rates; (3) the performance of their student subgroups; (4) the percentage of their students who are meeting or exceeding state academic achievement standards or are achieving sufficient academic growth; and (5) school gains. Allows states to provide each blue ribbon school with: (1) increased autonomy over its budget, staffing, and time; (2) flexibility in using funds provided to the school under the ESEA for any purpose allowed under the ESEA; and (3) a monetary award, through its LEA, if it agrees to use the reward to improve student achievement and provide technical assistance to the lowest-achieving schools in the state that are closest geographically to it. Directs the Secretary, acting jointly with the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), to designate exemplary early childhood education programs as centers of excellence in early childhood for a five-year term and award each of them a bonus grant to improve the quality of their program and others in their region. Requires eligible programs to have been nominated by their state Governor as centers of excellence and to serve children who are eligible to participate in the school lunch program. Requires the selection of at least one center of excellence in each state.  Requires the centers of excellence to use at least 15% of their bonus grant to disseminate best practices for achieving early academic success to other early childhood education programs in their state and to use the remainder for at least two of the following activities:    providing Head Start services to additional eligible young children;   extending services to provide full-day, full-week, or full-year care to children;   further coordinating early childhood education programs and services and social services in their community;   providing instructional and support staff with professional development;   developing or maintaining partnerships with institutions of higher education and nonprofit organizations that recruit, train, place, and support postsecondary students to serve as mentors and reading partners to preschool children in centers;   carrying out other activities to improve the overall quality of their early childhood education programs; and   sharing best practices concerning children's transition to elementary school.  Authorizes the Secretary to identify and recognize exemplary schools, programs, and individuals, including through: (1) a Green Ribbon Schools program that recognizes excellence in reducing environmental impact, increasing health and wellness, and providing sustainability education; and (2) an award program recognizing excellence exhibited by classified school employees in the public school system. (Sec. 1126) Directs the Secretary to award grants to states to develop, improve, or administer their college and career ready academic standards and assessments. Directs the Secretary to award competitive grants to states to enhance such assessments by: (1) collaborating with IHEs or other entities, (2) using multiple measures of student achievement from multiple sources, (3) charting student progress over time, or (4) developing comprehensive assessment instruments. (Sec. 1127) Provides that a state is free from all federal requirements under part A if the state chooses to not receive funding under that part. Reauthorizes appropriations under part A of title I of the ESEA for FY2014-FY2018. Part B: Pathways to College - (Sec. 1201) Replaces part B (Student Reading Skills Improvement Grants) of title I with a new part B (Pathways to College). Establishes, under subpart 1 (Improving Secondary Schools) of part B, a program awarding competitive, matching, five-year grants to high-need LEAs that partner with IHEs, employers or industry-related organizations, and nonprofit organizations or qualified intermediaries to assist schools in implementing innovative and effective secondary school reform strategies. Requires grantees to use up to 25% of their grant funds to:    implement an early warning indicator system to identify and assist struggling students in their high schools and feeder middle schools;   provide support and credit recovery opportunities for struggling secondary school students;   establish secondary school dropout recovery or reentry programs;  establish grade and school transition programs and supports; and   keep school staff, students, and families apprised of certain education requirements, processes, and opportunities.  Requires grantees to use at least 75% of their grant funds on certain efforts to: (1) reform secondary schools that have a graduation rate below 75% and are identified as low-performing schools, but not priority schools; and (2) improve the academic performance of students who attend middle schools that feed a majority of their students to those secondary schools. Requires those secondary school reforms to include:    personalized learning environments attuned to the needs of each student;   student engagement through applied learning opportunities;   flexible budget and staffing authority for school leaders;   training and collaborative opportunities for school staff;   improved curriculum and instruction;   activities that strengthen the transition from high school to postsecondary education; and   Graduation Promise Academies, Career Academies, dual enrollment programs, or Early College High Schools which represent specified strategies that have proven effective in preparing students for graduation, college, and a career.   Establishes a program, under subpart 2 (Accelerated Learning) of part B, allotting grants to states, based on their share of low-income elementary and secondary school students, to cover part or all of the Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) examination fee low-income students incur. Directs the Secretary to award competitive matching grants to states, high-need LEAs, or partnerships between a public or nonprofit organization and a state or high-need LEA for activities that increase: (1) the number of teachers at high-need schools who are qualified to teach AP or IB courses, and (2) the number of students at high-need schools who pass the examination for such courses.  Gives priority, in awarding the competitive grants, to applicants that: (1) have a statewide or district-wide strategy for increasing the availability of AP or IB courses, and pre-AP or pre-IB courses, in high-need schools; (2) focus on increasing AP or IB courses in core academic subjects; and (3) target high-need schools. Authorizes appropriations under part B's Pathways to College program for FY2014-FY2018. Part C: Education of Migratory Children - (Sec. 1301) Amends part C (Education of Migratory Children) of title I, which provides grants to states for the education of migratory children.  (Sec. 1303) Alters the formula for determining each state's grant by considering, in addition to other factors, the average number of migratory children residing in each state the preceding three years, rather than the number of migratory children who resided in each state the previous year. Requires the Secretary to develop and implement a procedure for monitoring the accuracy of estimates of the number of migratory children residing in each state. (Sec. 1304) Gives program priority to migratory children who have made a move within the year and are failing or at risk of failing or who have dropped out of school. (Sec. 1306) Requires migratory children to be given the opportunity to meet the same college and career readiness standards as other children. (Sec. 1308) Adds international coordination as an authorized use of the grants currently awarded to states, LEAs, IHEs, and other entities for improved intrastate and interstate coordination of migrant education. Allows the Secretary to provide technical assistance to states to support their efforts to meet the needs of migratory children. (Sec. 1309) Requires each state that receives a grant under part C to: (1) annually report to the Secretary and make public certain data regarding the academic achievement of migratory students, and (2) assist the Secretary in determining the number of migratory children in such state through such procedures as the Secretary may require. Requires the Secretary: (1) to evaluate the implementation and impact of the activities supported under part C, and (2) conduct a pilot study on the feasibility of using the National Assessment of Educational Progress for assessing and reporting on the academic achievement of migratory children in grades four and eight in reading and mathematics. Reauthorizes appropriations under part C of title I of the ESEA for FY2014-FY2018. Part D: Prevention and Intervention Programs for Children and Youth Who Are Neglected, Delinquent, or At-Risk - (Sec. 1401) Amends part D (Prevention and Intervention Programs for Children and Youth Who are Neglected, Delinquent, or At-Risk) of title I. (Sec. 1402) Requires the Secretary to reserve 0.5% of the amount appropriated for part D in any fiscal year to provide assistance to the Secretary of the Interior to provide educational services for at-risk Indian children, including Indian youth in correctional facilities operated by the Secretary of the Interior or by an Indian tribe.  (Sec. 1403) Requires states that desire grants under part D to establish: (1) procedures to ensure that students who have been placed in the juvenile justice system are promptly re-enrolled in secondary school or placed in re-entry programs that best meet their educational and social needs, (2) procedures for facilitating the transfer of credits that such students earned during placement, and (3) opportunities for those students to participate in higher education or career pathways.

Defines a \"charter school\" as a public school that: (1) is governed by a separate and independent board that exercises authority over at least one school; and (2) has significant autonomy in the areas of staffing, budget, schedule, and instructional programs. Directs the Secretary, under subpart 1, to award competitive grants to states, LEAs, charter school authorizers, or charter management organizations to award subgrants to developers to create, expand, or replicate high-performing charter schools. Defines \"high-performing charter schools\" as those that have for the student body and each specified student subgroup: (1) academic achievement and growth results that are significantly higher than the average results in demographically similar schools in the state; (2) student retention rates that are similar to or higher than the average rates in demographically similar schools in the state; and (3) for high schools, higher rates of graduation and student enrollment and persistence at IHEs than the average such rates in demographically similar schools in the state. Requires charter schools that are not yet open to have a written performance contract with a charter school authorizer that includes such goals. Directs the Secretary to award at least 25% of the grant funds to states and to give priority to states that: (1) do not prohibit or effectively inhibit increasing the number of high-performing charter schools in such state; (2) support at least two charter school authorizers, at least one of which is a statewide authorizer; and (3) ensure that charter schools are reauthorized or have their charter renewed at least once every five years. Sets the initial term of a grant at no more than three years, but allows the Secretary to renew a grant for an additional two years if the grantee is achieving grant objectives and performance targets. Permits the Secretary to waive certain statutory or regulatory requirements if the waiver is requested by a grant applicant and promotes the purpose of the grant program without affecting what is definitionally required of charter schools. Requires grantees to provide equitable access to, and effectively serve the needs of, all students, including disabled children and English learners. Gives grant priority to applicants, and subgrant priority to developers, that propose to create, expand, or replicate high-performing charter schools that enroll a large percentage of students from low-income families.  Requires each grantee to establish performance measures and annual targets, approved by the Secretary, for the charter schools created, expanded, or replicated with funds under subpart 1.

Title I: Improving Basic Programs Operated by State and Local Educational Agencies - Amends the school improvement program under part A of title I of the ESEA to eliminate the requirement that local educational agencies (LEAs) and schools make adequate yearly progress toward state academic content and achievement standards.  Requires states to adopt challenging academic content and achievement standards for mathematics, reading or language arts, and science that ensure that all of their public school students graduate from high school fully prepared for postsecondary education or the workforce. Requires states to implement a set of high-quality assessments of student progress toward those standards in mathematics and reading or language arts that: (1) involve multiple measures of student achievement; (2) measure the overall performance of students in each public school and the performance of their poor, minority, disabled, and English learner subgroups; and (3) are used as the primary means of determining the yearly performance of each of their schools. Allows states to adopt alternate academic achievement standards and assessments for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities. Requires states to annually: (1) identify their public schools that need improvement based on the overall performance of their students, achievement gaps between student subgroups, or graduation rates; and (2) assist their LEAs in developing and implementing appropriate improvement strategies for such schools. Includes among the assistance strategies that LEAs must develop for schools their state has identified as needing improvement:  replacing the school's principal; replacing ineffective teachers; giving the school the operational flexibility needed to fully implement a comprehensive strategy to improve student achievement; providing ongoing, high-quality professional development to instructional staff; implementing strategies to recruit, place, and retain effective staff; using data to identify and implement an instructional program that is aligned with state academic standards or to inform and differentiate instruction that meets the needs of individual students; converting a school or closing and reopening the school;  closing a school and enrolling it students in higher performing schools; and adopting a new governance structure for the school.   Allows LEAs to give students in those schools the option to transfer to another public school in their jurisdiction, provided the option is not prohibited by state law. Eliminates the requirement that all teachers be highly qualified, requiring instead that they meet applicable state certification and licensure requirements. Authorizes states to allocate their part A grants among LEAs on the basis of the number of impoverished children enrolled in each LEA's public schools. Replaces the program under part B (Student Reading Skills Improvement Grants) with a program awarding grants to states to assist them in developing academic assessments and academic content and achievement standards. Repeals: (1) the demonstrations of innovative practices, assessment evaluation, and Close Up Fellowship programs under part E; (2) part F (Comprehensive School Reform); (3) part G (Advanced Placement Programs); and (4) part H (School Dropout Prevention) of title I of the ESEA. Eliminates fiscal maintenance of effort requirements imposed on LEAs receiving funds under part A. Title II: High-Quality Teachers and Principals - Creates a new title II (Preparing, Training, and Recruiting High Quality Teachers and Principals) of the ESEA consisting of a part A (Fund for the Improvement of Teaching and Learning) and part B (Teacher Incentive Fund). Moves teacher liability and internet safety provisions to title IX of the ESEA. Allocates part A grants to states and, through them, subgrants to LEAs pursuant to a formula that apportions: (1) 20% of the funding to states and LEAs on the basis of their share of students aged 5-17 on the national and state level, respectively; and (2) 80% of such funding on the basis of their share of impoverished students in that age group. Requires states to use 95% of those funds for subgrants to LEAs, with the remainder being used for specified state activities. Lists the projects which the subgrants may fund, including: (1) teacher and principal recruitment, training, and retention efforts; (2) teacher and principal evaluation systems that are based in significant part on student achievement; (3) model instructional programs in the core academic subjects; (4) measures that improve students' access to school library materials, postsecondary level coursework, and extended learning opportunities; and (5) the provision of general liability insurance coverage to teachers. Requires those projects to meet certain principles of effectiveness and undergo a periodic evaluation to assess their progress in providing students with a high-quality education in the core academic subjects that improves student academic achievement. Directs the Secretary of Education to: (1) provide technical assistance to part A grantees and subgrantees; (2) evaluate part A activities; and (3) award competitive matching grants to institutions of higher education or national educational organizations to provide LEAs with teachers and school leaders from nontraditional routes, professional development activities, and other services and learning opportunities. Directs the Secretary to reserve at least 10% of the funding under title II for the part B program, after reserving funds for certain national activities under part A. Authorizes the Secretary to award competitive matching grants under part B to states, LEAs, or partnerships between those entities and profit or nonprofit organizations to develop, implement, improve, or expand performance-based compensation systems for teachers and principals. Requires priority to be given to grant applicants that focus on teachers and principals serving in high-need schools. Directs the Secretary to arrange for an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of part B programs. Title III: Safe and Healthy Students -  Replaces title IV (21st Century Schools) of the ESEA with a new title IV (Safe and Healthy Students) program.  Moves the gun-free schools requirement and part C (Environmental Tobacco Smoke) of title IV to title IX (General Provisions) of the ESEA. Allots grants to states and, through them, subgrants to LEAs in amounts that reflect their share of impoverished children aged 5-17 on the national and state level, respectively. Requires states to use 98% of those funds for subgrants to LEAs. Requires the subgrants to be used to develop, implement, and evaluate comprehensive programs and activities that: (1) improve students' physical and mental health, diet, and physical fitness; (2) prevent and reduce substance abuse, school violence, and bullying; and (3) strengthen parent and community involvement in these efforts. Requires those programs and activities to meet certain principles of effectiveness and undergo a periodic evaluation to assess their progress in improving students' safety, health, and fitness. Title IV: Empowering Parents through Quality Charter Schools - Repeals part A (Innovative Programs), subpart 3 (Voluntary Public School Choice Programs) of part B (Public Charter Schools), and part D (Fund for the Improvement of Education) of title V (Promoting Informed Parental Choice and Innovative Programs) of the ESEA. Revises the program currently under subpart 1 (Charter School Programs) of part B and subsumes the program currently under subpart 2 (Credit Enhancement Initiatives to Assist Charter School Facility Acquisition, Construction, and Renovation) under that revised program. Replaces the current charter school grant program with a program awarding renewable competitive grants to states, authorized public chartering agencies, and LEAs and, through them, renewable subgrants to charter school developers to open new charter schools and expand and replicate high-quality charter schools.  Requires such grantees to use 10% of the grant funds to provide technical assistance to subgrantees and authorized public chartering agencies and to work with those agencies to improve the charter school authorization process. Makes authorized public chartering agencies, LEAs, and charter management organizations eligible to receive renewable competitive grants to open new charter schools and expand and replicate high-quality charter schools. Revises the per-pupil facilities aid program (under which the Secretary makes competitive matching grants to states to provide per-pupil financing to charter schools) to allow states to: (1) partner with organizations to provide up to 50% of the state share of funding for the program; and (2) receive more than one program grant, so long as the amount of the grant funds provided to charter schools increases with each successive grant. Directs the Secretary to conduct certain national activities that include awarding competitive grants directly to charter school developers to open, replicate, and expand charter schools in states that have not received, or are nearing the end of, a grant for that purpose. Allows charter schools to serve prekindergarten or postsecondary school students. Title V: State Innovation and Flexibility - Amends title VI (Flexibility and Accountability) of the ESEA to allow LEAs to transfer up to 100% of their allocations under titles II and IV between the two programs or into the school improvement program under part A of title I. Allows states to do the same with the amounts allotted to them under such programs for state level activities.  Amends title IX (General Provisions) of the ESEA to revise the process by which states, LEAs, and Indian tribes obtain waivers of the Act's statutory and regulatory requirements. Prohibits the Secretary from imposing requirements on states, LEAs, or Indian tribes in exchange for the approval of a waiver request. Repeals the requirement that LEAs maintain their education funding at certain levels in order to receive funds under covered ESEA programs. Establishes an approval and disapproval process for state plans and LEA applications under titles II and IV of the ESEA.
